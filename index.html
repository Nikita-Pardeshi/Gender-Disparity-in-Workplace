    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p> Women’s involvement in the labor market has changed in several notable ways over the past
      several decades. All over the world, discriminatory laws continue to threaten women’s economic
      security, career growth, and work–life balance. Such barriers to employment and
      entrepreneurship at every stage of life limit equality of opportunity, creating a business
      environment that does not adequately support working women.

    </p>

    <p> Today, women have just three-quarters of the legal rights of men; in 1970, it was less than half.
      Over 2 billion women don’t have the same employment options as men.
      At the current rate, it will take about a century to close the global pay gap.
      The <a
        href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/32639/9781464815324.pdf?sequence=6&isAllowed=y"
        target="_blank">
        Women, Business and the Law 2020 report</a> presented
      results on how laws have changed since 1970.
      This project explores global gender wage disparity holistically, understands the economic indicators
      such as
      gender equality index, GDP, inheritance rights, financial independence and gauges if there
      exists a relationship between them and wage inequality. An analysis on the aid set aside for bridging
      this gap is also explored. We aim to provide a detailed overview of how the employment numbers have changed
      over the last 72 years and the laws/reforms that have aided their improvements over the years.</p>

    <p>
   
      <b>Why is this important?</b>
      <br>
      Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations.
      Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy.
      In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP
      increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy. A range of public policies and
      societal, educational, and labour market transformations over generations
      have done little to close the gender wage gap around the world. Today, the wage gap between the median
      earnings of full-time working women and men stands at 13%, on average, across OECD countries.

    <h1>Results</h1>
    <h2>Gender Wage Disparity in Numbers</h2>
    <p>The gender pay gap (or the gender wage gap) is a metric that tells us the difference in pay (or wages, or income)
      between women and men. It’s a measure of inequality and captures a concept that is broader than the concept of
      equal pay for equal work.</p>
    <p>According to pew research<a
        href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/25/gender-pay-gap-facts/"><sup>1</sup></a>, much of this gap
      has been explained by measurable factors such as educational
      attainment, occupational segregation and work experience. The narrowing of the gap is attributable in large part
      to gains women have made in each of these dimensions. Even though women have increased their presence in
      higher-paying jobs traditionally dominated by men, such as
      professional and managerial positions, women as a whole continue to be overrepresented in lower-paying occupations
      relative to their share of the workforce.</p>

    <h4>Controlled Wages and Uncontrolled Wages</h4>
    <p>The controlled gender pay gap is $0.99 for every $1 men make, which is one cent closer to equal but still not
      equal. The
      controlled gender pay gap tells us what women earn compared to men when all compensable factors are accounted for
      such
      as job title, education, experience, industry, job level, and hours worked.
      In other words, women who are doing the same job as a man, with the exact same qualifications as a man, are still
      paid
      one percent less than men at the median. The closing of the controlled gender pay gap
      has
      been extremely slow, shrinking by only a fraction of one percent year over year. It has shrunk a total of $0.02
      since
      2015<a href="https://www.payscale.com/research-and-insights/gender-pay-gap/"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <br>

    <p style="background-color: #444; color: #fff; width: 100px; text-align: center;">Findings</p>
    <p>In 2022, the uncontrolled gender pay gap is $0.82 for every $1 that men make, which is the same as last year. The
      uncontrolled gender pay gap as the name suggests do not take into accoun measureable factors such as job title,
      education, experience, industry, job level, and hours worked.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Gender Inequality Index</h4>
    <p>The Human Development Report produced by the UN includes a composite index that captures gender inequalities
      across
      several dimensions, including economic status.
      This index, called the Gender Inequality Index, measures inequalities in three dimensions: reproductive health
      (based on
      maternal mortality ratio and adolescent birth rates); empowerment (based on proportion of parliamentary seats
      occupied
      by females and proportion of adult females aged 25 years and older with at least some secondary education); and
      economic
      status (based on labour market participation rates of female and male populations aged 15 years and older).

      The map shows scores, country by country.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #444; color: #fff; width: 100px; text-align: center;">Findings</p>
    <p>According to the Gender Inequality Index (GII), Switzerland was the most gender equal country in the world.
      Numbers on how long it will take to close gender gaps highly differ between regions. In Western Europe it is
      estimated
      that it will take around 52 years to achieve equality between the genders. In South Asia, on the other hand, it is
      supposed to take 195 years. New data shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased female poverty worldwide and
      widened
      the gender poverty gap even further. Heightened female poverty will also negatively impact the Gender Inequality
      Index
      (GII)<a

    <h4>Change in Gender Wage Disparity from 1980 - 2010</h4>

    <p>Here we further detail on the contribution of particular labor-market characteristics to the gender
      wage gap. Specifically, it shows the fraction of the total gender wage
      gap in 1980 and 2010 accounted for by gender differences in each group of variables
      for both the human capital and full specifications
    </p>
    <p>Gender disparity has been increasing with respect to certain factors such as race, Occupation but has reduced
      in parts thanks to Education, Unionisation. As we can see there are unexplained reason why it still persists,
      pointing to the lack of data in this area.</p>

    <p> Chart exemplifies following<a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel"><sup>4</sup></a> :-
    <ol>
      <li>By 2010, due to the education reversal,
        women’s higher level of education slightly raised their relative wage.</li>
      <li>Gender differences
        in occupation accounted for a larger pay gap
        in 2010 than in 1980. However, while women upgraded
        their occupations during this period, the
        wage consequences of gender differences in
        occupations became larger as well</li>
      <li>The continued importance of occupation and industry in accounting for the gender gap, and the rise in the
        relative importance of these factors, suggests
        that future research on explanations might
        fruitfully focus on gender differences in
        employment distributions and their causes</li>
      <li>The "unexplained"
        percentage refers to the residual that remains after all other factors are accounted for – it is often seen as
        discrimination.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <br>
    <h4>Gender Wage Disparity across Age</h4>
    <p>The United States Census Bureau defines the pay gap as the ratio between median wages – that is, they measure the
      gap by
      calculating the wages of men and women at the middle of the earnings distribution, and dividing them.</p>

    <div style="padding-left: 50px;">

    <p style="background-color: #444; color: #fff; width: 100px; text-align: center;">Findings</p>
    <p>Gender wage
      becomes more pronounced after 44 for uncontrolled wage gap. The controlled wage gap is the same after
      29 years and above.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Analysis of Relationship between GDP and Gender Wage Gap</h4>
    <p>Here, we are trying to analyse the relationship between GDP per capita and Gender Wage Gap. As we can see there
      is a weak positive correlation between GDP per capita and the gender pay gap. However, the
      chart shows that the relationship is not really linear. Actually, middle-income countries tend to have the
      smallest pay
      gap. The fact that middle-income countries have low gender wage gaps is, to a large extent, the result of
      selection of
      women
      into employment.</p>

    <br>

    <p style="background-color: #444; color: #fff; width: 100px; text-align: center;">Findings</p>
    <p>Rather than reflect greater equality, the lower wage gaps observed in some countries could indicate that only
      women
      with certain characteristics – for instance, with no husband or children – are entering the workforce.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Change in Representation of Women in Top 10% Income Group</h4>
    <p>Despite having fallen in recent decades, there remains a substantial pay gap between the average wages of men and
      women. But what does gender inequality look like if we focus on the very top of the income distribution and is
      there any evidence of so-called glass ceiling?</p>
    <p>Using tax records,
      tkinson, Casarico and Voitchovsky (2018) investigated the incomes of women and men separately across high-income
      countries. </p>

    <p style="background-color: #444; color: #fff; width: 100px; text-align: center;">Findings</p>
    <p>
      While investment income tends to make up a larger share of the total income of rich individuals in general, the
      authors
      found this to be particularly marked in the case of women in top income groups. We can find that for the top 10%
      income group the change is very slow even in the high income countries.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Regional Averages of Composite Gender Equality Index</h4>
    <p>The gender equality index is based on gender ratios across four dimensions:
    <ol>
      <li>Health</li>
      <li>Socio-economic resources</li>
      <li>Gender disparities in the household</li>
      <li>Gender disparities in politics</li>
    </ol>
    Higher scores denote less inequality<a href="https://eige.europa.eu/gender-equality-index/2021"><sup>4</sup></a>.

    <p>From the chart below, the trend
      is
      in the right direction except for Easter Europe during 1980's which can be attributed to the aftermath of the
      Fall of Berlin wall and the civis dicord that arose as a result of it.

    <h1>Change in Women's Participation in the Workforce</h1>
    <p>As time progressed, attitudes about women working and their employment prospects changed. 
      Between the 1930s and mid-1970s, 
      women’s participation in the economy continued to rise, with the gains primarily owing to an increase 
      in work among married women. By 1970, 50 percent of single women and 40 percent of married women were 
      participating in the labor force. Several factors contributed to this rise.
      The datasets are analyzed to understand how gender dynamics has changed in the labor force and 
      potential reasons
      for the change.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h4><b>Has Female Participation in Labor Force Grew Remarkably in the 20th Century?</b></h4>
    <p style="font-weight: normal;font-size: 15; text-align: justify;">The lineplot depicts the changes in the female
      labor force participation rates from 1960 to 2020.
      The female labor force participation rate corresponds to the proportion of the female population aged 15 and older
      that
      are economically active. The trendline for United States is highlighted in blue color and the dropdown on the top
      right corner gives user the ability to select different
      countries and analyze the trends.<br>

        <figcaption>Figure 8: Changes in Female Participation rates (1960-2020) </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <br>

      <p style="background-color: #444; color: #fff; width: 100px; text-align: center;">Findings</p>
      The visualization shows that there are positive trends across all the major countries. Looking at the plot, it is
      evident from that the 20th century saw a radical increase in the number of women
      participating in labor force across all the major countries although the growth in participation began at
      different points in time, and proceeded at different rates for different countries.<br>
      Moreover, the plot helps in better understanding of where United States stands when compared to some of the other
      countries with the better Female Labor force participation rates in the world. From the chart, we can understand
      that a few countries have been consistent in ratio improvement when compared to US.
      Another interesting aspect is how the ratio in the United States remained constant after 2000.

    From the chart, we can clearly see that the increase in the labor force participation rate may be attributed
    to an increase in participation among married women. Married women drove the increase in female labor force
    participation
    in the United States.
    Better work policies for women and favorable maternity policies have helped increase participation among
    married women.

    <h2>Measuring Laws and Regulations</h2>

    <p>
      The pursuit of gender equality is an uphill battle. The recent OECD assessment of how
      well countries are doing in implementing policy measures aimed at reaching gender
      equality goals is crystal clear: they need to do more. In particular, despite major
      improvements in the education of young girls, the rising labour force participation of
      women and widespread laws against gender discrimination, women’s position in the labour
      market severely lags behind that of men, and the gender gap in labour income remains a
      global phenomenon.
    </p>

    <p>To demonstrate where laws facilitate or hinder women’s economic participation,
      Women, Business and the Law 2020 presented an index covering 190 economies and
      structured around the life cycle of a working woman. To ensure comparability, the
      woman in question is assumed to reside in the main business city of her economy and
      to be employed in the formal sector. Below are the 8 indicators:
    </p>
    <div style="padding-left: 170px;">
    <img src="laws and regulations\law-indicators.PNG" width="900">
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <p>
      Women, Business and the Law (WBL) measures legal differences between men's and women's access
      to economic opportunities in 190 economies. Thirty-five aspects of the law are scored
      across eight indicators of four or five binary questions. Each indicator represents a
      different phase of a woman's career.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Regulations by Country (1970-2022)</h4>
    <p>The chart on the left shows the total laws passed with respect to gender equality and the WBL index score. A higher WBL index score indicates higher gender equality in the country. The chart on the left shows a timeline of the reforms passed in each country and when the mouse is hovered over any point the details of the reform including it's description, the year it was made and whether it was in a positive or negative direction can be seen. This chart can be used to compare laws among countries with higher scores v/s those with lower scores. It can help the viewer take inspiration as to what laws are made in countries with higher equality as well as laws made in neighboring countries with similar cultural backgrounds that can be applied successfully in a given country.</p>

    <br>
    <p style="background-color: #444; color: #fff; width: 100px; text-align: center;">Findings</p>
    <p>Legal changes enacted in the Middle East and North Africa resulted in 10 positive
      data changes, more than any other region. Despite its low scores, the region advanced
      the most because of its reform efforts, with 25 percent of economies implementing
      at least one reform. Economies in Europe and Central Asia also implemented reforms,
      despite having scores above the global average, with 17 percent changing at least
      one law to improve legal equality for women. Progress in the rest of the world was
      slower.
    </p>

    <p>
      12 economies—Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia,
      Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden—score 100, meaning that women are on
      an equal legal standing with men across all of the areas measured.
    </p>

    <br>

    <br>

    <h4>Analysis of Progression in Index Scores by Country from 1970-2021</h4>
    <br>

    <p>The Women, Business and the Law index measures explicit discrimination in the law,
      legal rights, and the provision of certain benefits, areas in which reforms can bolster
      women’s labor force participation. Governments can use this framework to identify
      barriers to women’s success, remove them, and boost economic inclusion. The eight Women, Business and the Law indicators coincide with the milestones that many women experience throughout
      their adult lives. Questions included in the indicators were chosen based on evidence from the economic literature as well as
      statistically significant associations with outcomes related to women’s economic empowerment, such as employment and
      business ownership. <br><br>

      The graph below visualizes the progressions of index scores for each of the above indicators by country.

    <p style="background-color: #444; color: #fff; width: 100px; text-align: center;">Findings</p>

    <p>
      The Mobility, Workplace, Marriage, Entrepreneurship, and Assets indicators have
      an average global score above 80, meaning that most economies have removed
      restrictions or introduced the relevant legal rights and protections measured by these
      indicators. Average scores are lower for the Pay, Parenthood, and Pension
      indicators. Parenthood, with an average score of 55.6, has the most room
      to improve, followed by the Pay indicator.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>


    <br>
    <br>

    <h4>Parenthood</h4>

    <p>
      Childbirth and early career events play a crucial role in the widening of gender disparities over the life course.
      Not only do women experience slightly fewer job changes than men on average, but the nature
      of their labour market mobility also differs from that of men. Women do experience
      in-work transitions – change of employer, job or contract type – but less often than men,
      and they tend to have fewer in-work transitions that occur at the beginning of men’s
      careers. By contrast, in almost all countries, women move part-time and enter inactivity
      more often than men, although they also exit inactivity more often too.

      Fewer in-work transitions for women than men during the early years of their careers,
      particularly around the time of childbirth, translate into lower earnings growth.

    </p>


    <p>
      On average, the gender gap in the career length of parents is more than twice as
      large as that of childless workers. Recent research supports this point, indicating that
      paternity leave is associated with greater relationship stability. That may be because
      when fathers take leave, it signals a greater investment in family life—reducing the
      burden on the mother and strengthening parental relationships.

      The above two charts represents the number of paid paternity and maternity leaves granted by
      federal governments across different countries through each of the five continents. Until a few years,

      recognize Paternal leaves as an important policy.

        <b>Africa: </b>African countries have accounted well for women's rights in terms
        of providing paid maternity leaves to mothers. But have not given the same or even

    It is important to summarize what is currently being said about the wage gap to be updated on the topics and people
    being spoken about as well as the demands of people. News articles tend to have more of a report of the current
    status whereas 'tweets' have tend to be the opinion of the general public on the matter. Speeches given by political
    leaders show their standing on the matter. If we can find out what peoples concerns are, what the need and leaders
    that can help efforts can be focused in that direction. The summary chart here is made using news articles and
    'tweets' written from January 2022 to April 2022 and the political speeches are from US politicians since the year

    <h1>Discussion</h1>

    <p>
      Awareness of gender issues has primarily been brought about as a result of the work of
      the women’s movement and of feminist politics, which includes work on gender equality,
      challenging the status and roles of women and men in society, and addressing the
      creation of gendered stereotypes. For this reason, there is a tendency to associate
      gender with women and women’s issues alone. Without bias and one-sided opinions, this project addresses
      the gender disparity issues with both men and women.
    </p>

    <p>
      People may be highly attuned to signs of gender in the environment, while not
      necessarily being able to reflect on how these signs have become gendered. By means of this project, the important
      issues across all areas of gender bias have been raised and given substantial data driven evidence
      for.
    </p>



    <p><b>Why should we care about gender equality?</b></p>
    <p>Advancing gender
      equality is critical to all
      areas of a healthy society, from reducing poverty to promoting the
      health, education, protection and the well-being of girls and boys.
      Investing in education
      programmes for girls and
      increasing the age at which
      they marry can return
      $5 for every dollar spent.
      Investing in programs
      improving income-generating activities for women
      can return $7 dollars
      for every dollar spent.</p>

    <p><b>Why is it important to take gender concerns into account in programme design and implementation?</b></p>
    <p>There are two very important reasons. First, there are differences between the roles of
      men and women, differences that demand different approaches. Second, there is systemic
      inequality between men and women. This pattern of inequality is a constraint to the progress of any society
      because it limits the
      opportunities of one-half of its population.Understanding and addressing this inherit inequality
      will lead towards better policy making, a more fairer justice and judicial systems and a better
      work life balance for both men and women.
    </p>

    <p><b>What can we do to
        fix these issues?</b></p>
    <p>
      If you are a girl, you
      can stay in school, help
      empower your female
      classmates to do the same
      and fight for your right to
      access sexual and reproductive health services.
      If you are a woman, you
      can address unconscious
      biases and implicit associations that form an
      unintended and often
      an invisible barrier to
      equal opportunity.
      If you are a man or a
      boy, you can work alongside women and girls to
      achieve gender equality
      and embrace healthy,
      respectful relationships.</p>

    <p><b>The gender pay gap measures inequality but not necessarily discrimination.</b></p>

    <p>Through the visualizations and analysis in this project, we hope the readers develop
      an unbiased opinion towards gender equality, understand both sides of the coin and reflect
      on what has been done in the past and what can be improved for the next generations.

  <!--START------------CONCLUSION--->

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      Wage disparity based on race, age and gender is an prevelant issue that is being addressed albeit at a glacial
      pace. It is
      imperative that we understand that issue exists so that we can work towards eliminating it. Countries with higher
      GDP also has gender wage disparity but the fact that we have data and studies are being made on it is a step in
      the right direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The increase in women's participation in the workforce was arguably the most significant change in the economy in
      the past century.
      Women's increased labor force participation represents a significant change in the U.S. economy since 1960.
      It can be said that most of the long-run increase in the participation of women in the labor force in the United
      States is
      attributed specifically due to an increase in the participation of married women.
      However, the analysis also shows that the growth in the United States as well as some other rich countries has
      slowed down
      considerably or even stopped at the turn of the 21st century. Also, despite recent growth in female participation
      rates,
      men still tend to participate in labor markets more frequently than women in most of the countries.
    <p>

    <p>
      Nineteen economies score 0 on Parenthood, meaning
      that they do not have any of the good practices measured by this indicator (leave for
      mothers of at least 14 weeks, which is fully administered by the government, leave for
      fathers, parental leave, and prohibition of dismissal of pregnant women). Only 31 out of
      190 economies score 100.
    </p>

    <p>
      Six out of the seven regions improved their scores and reduced the gaps in legal
      rights and opportunities for women, at least on the books. The Middle
      East and North Africa had the largest improvement, followed by SubSaharan Africa,
      Europe and Central Asia, and East Asia and the
      Pacific. South Asia’s average score remains unchanged from the previous years.
    </p>
    <p>We hope that the readers can utilise the information presented here in making informed decisions on disparity
      that does not
      have merit and collectively do our part.</p>
