### Section: Gender disparity in numbers
1. This section introduces the concept of gender disparity - controlled and uncontrolled wages
2. There are 4 charts in the section and below is the thought process behind selecting each of them :-
		a. Map - providing gender pay gap from 1986 to 2020. Slider using a choropleth is the most ideal way of  displaying all information along with showing the changes unlike bar charts etc.
		b. Gender wage gap from 1980 and 2010 - a horizontal bar plot was selected to show the changes between the 2 years within a single plot to notice the changes
		c. Joint-plot - the relationship between GDP and wage disparity is evident in this plot. It also shows the regions where the disparity is higher and also provides the distribution of wage gap and GDP, per capita.
		d. The line plot also provides a holistic view of the change in equality index in different regions
3. The tasks and plots for this section are 85% the same as that described in the proposal section.

5. Data Processing
		1. Tidying data and merging files so that the animations can work
		2. Data type changes

### Section: Merging Laws and regulations

1. The 2 charts representing the number of paid maternal and paternal leaves is a unique polar chart. The data can be represented by means of a simple bar chart but to optimize user's view and comprehensively including the major countries of each continent in a creative way. In the one graph all the continents and the major countries can be evaluated together. 

2. Users have an option to dig deeper into each continent and view all the countries (for which data is available) and play around with the data. 

3. The tasks and plots for this section are 90% the same as mentioned in the proposal previosuly. Findings have been noted for each graph.

6. Data Processing: Region column was added to the data to represent countries belonging to a continent. Certain variables were used for this visualization. Data was converted to long format

### Section: Change in women's participation in the workforce

1. The line plots indicates how the gender dynamics has changed in the labor force over the years and how married women drove the increase in female labor force participation in the United States.  The line plot allows users to interact with graphs on display and point value display allowing for a better storytelling experience. Findings have been noted against each graph.


2. The next two bar plots represents more details on the Female Labor Force changes. It depicts the distribution of the Female Labor Force by Age, Race and Hispanic ethnicity and the changes in female employment-to-population ratios across the world. Being able to navigate through the visualizations smoothly plays a huge part in communicating data.<br>
The Animated Bar Plot also helps users to visualize how the top Countries have moved over a few years period, based on its female employment-to-population ratios.


3. The interactive world map illustrates the ratio between female and male labor participation rates over the years.
The map display divides the geographical areas that are colored, shaded and patterned in relation to a data variable ( i.e., Female to male participation Ratio). This provides a way to visualize values over a geographical area, which can show variation or patterns across the displayed location. The data variable uses color progression ( a blending from one color to another) to represent itself in each region of the map. <br>
Also, the Slider bar present transitions between different years. Users also have the option to dig deeper into each continent details over any particular year. This map  provides an easy way to visualize how gender gap ratio varies across a geographic area and show the level of variability over a period of time.

4. The tasks and plots for this section have changed from the initial proposal. Although the visualization goal remains the same , the visual implementations have evolved. The knowledge on Timeseries and building interactive charts helped change the outlook on building visualizations that can tell the story in a more impactful and easier manner. I have tried to incorporate time series in most of my charts. These charts also provide users the flexibility of getting data for a certain timeframe and more user interaction are added to make visualization more appealing and interesting.

### Section: Summary of Media Coverage

1. The 3 bubble plots are used to summarize news articles, tweets and political speech. They show the most frequently used terms in association with gender pay gap. A bubble plot was used in place of a word cloud to explore a different way to represent word frequencies.

2. The users can choose which chart they want displayed. They can hover over the bubbles to find the count of each of the words. A different color scheme was  used for each of the charts. The news chart has different colors as they're are from different sources and there is no specific grouping of the articles. The twitter chart uses twitters colors to draw a connection to twitter. In the political speeches chart the aim was to not use blue and red to avoid confusing the user into thinking that the terms had any relation with the democratic or republican parties. 

3. The plot type or task in this section has not changed from what was mentioned in the proposal. The findings have been added to this section below the chart.
