"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, everybody.    All right.  Well, thanks to my friend, Lilly Ledbetter, not only for that introduction but for fighting for a simple principle:  Equal pay for equal work.  It's not that complicated.  And, Lilly, I assure you, you remain the face of fair pay.    People don't want my mug on there.    They want your face.  

As Lilly mentioned, she did not set out to be a trailblazer. She was just somebody who was waking up every day, going to work, doing her job the best that she could.  And then one day, she finds out, after years, that she earned less than her male colleagues for doing the same job.  I want to make that point again.    Doing the same job.  Sometimes when you -- when we discuss this issue of fair pay, equal pay for equal work, and the pay gap between men and women, you’ll hear all sorts of excuses about, well, they’re child-bearing, and they’re choosing to do this, and they’re this and they’re that and the other.  She was doing the same job -- probably doing better.  (Laughter and applause.)  Same job.  Working just as hard, probably putting in more hours.  But she was getting systematically paid less.   

And so she set out to make sure this country lived up to its founding, the idea that all of us are created equal.  And when the courts didn’t answer her call, Congress did. 

The first time Lilly and I stood together in this room was my tenth day in office, and that's when we signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.    First bill I signed into law.  And some of the leaders who helped make that happen are here today, including Leader Pelosi and Senator Mikulski and Congresswoman DeLauro.    I want to thank all the members of Congress and all the state legislators who are here  and all the advocates who are here, because you all contributed to that effort.  And I want to give a special thanks to the members of the National Equal Pay Task Force, who’ve done outstanding work to make workplaces across America more fair.
We’re here because today is Equal Pay Day.    Equal Pay Day.  And it's nice to have a day, but it's even better to have equal pay.    And our job is not finished yet. Equal Pay Day means that a woman has to work about this far into 2014 to earn what a man earned in 2013.  Think about that.  A woman has got to work about three more months in order to get what a man got because she’s paid less.  That's not fair.  That’s like adding an extra six miles to a marathon.    It’s not right.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Ain’t right.

THE PRESIDENT:  Ain’t right.    It's not right and it ain’t right.   

America should be a level playing field, a fair race for everybody -- a place where anybody who’s willing to work hard has a chance to get ahead.  And restoring that opportunity for every American -- men and women -- has to be a driving focus for our country. 

Now, the good news is today our economy is growing; businesses have created almost 9 million new jobs over the past four years.   More than 7 million Americans have signed up for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act.  
That’s a good thing, too.  I know it’s Equal Pay Day and not Obamacare Day -- (laughter) -- but I do want to point out that the Affordable Care Act guarantees free preventive care, like mammograms and contraceptive care, for tens of millions of women, and ends the days when you could be charged more just for being a woman when it comes to your health insurance.    And that’s true for everybody.    That’s just one more place where things were not fair. 

We’ll talk about drycleaners next, right -- (laughter) -- because I know that -- I don’t know why it costs more for Michelle’s blouse than my shirt.   

But we’ve got to make sure that America works for everybody. Anybody who is willing to work hard, they should be able to get ahead.  And we’ve got to build an economy that works for everybody, not just those at the top.  Restoring opportunity for all has to be our priority.  That’s what America is about.  It doesn’t matter where you started off, what you look like -- you work hard, you take responsibility, you make the effort, you should be able to get ahead. 

And we’ve got to fight for an opportunity agenda, which means more good jobs that pay good wages, and training Americans to make sure that they can fill those jobs, and guaranteeing every child a world-class education, and making sure the economy rewards hard work for every single American. 

And part of that is fighting for fair pay for women -- because when women succeed, America succeeds.    When women succeed, America succeeds.  It’s true.  I believe that.    It’s true.  It’s true.  It's true. 

Now, here’s the challenge:  Today, the average full-time working woman earns just 77 cents for every dollar a man earns; for African American women, Latinas, it’s even less.  And in 2014, that’s an embarrassment.  It is wrong.  And this is not just an issue of fairness.  It’s also a family issue and an economic issue, because women make up about half of our workforce and they’re increasingly the breadwinners for a whole lot of families out there.  So when they make less money, it means less money for gas, less money for groceries, less money for child care, less money for college tuition, less money is going into retirement savings. 

And it’s all bad for business, because our economy depends on customers out there, and when customers have less money, when hardworking women don’t have the resources, that’s a problem.  When businesses lose terrific women talent because they’re fed up with unfair policies, that’s bad for business.  They lose out on the contributions that those women could be making.  When any of our citizens can’t fulfill their potential for reasons that have nothing to do with their talent or their character or their work ethic, we’re not living up to our founding values.  We don’t have second-class citizens in this country -- and certainly not in the workplace.

So, tomorrow, the Senate has the chance to start making this right by passing a bill that Lilly already alluded to -- the Paycheck Fairness Act.    They’ve got a chance to do the right thing.  And it would put sensible rules into place, like making sure employees who discuss their salaries don’t face retaliation by their employers. 

And here’s why this is important.  There are women here today who worked in offices where it was against the rules for employees to discuss salaries with one another.  And because of that, they didn’t know they were being paid less than men -- just like Lilly didn’t know -- for doing the exact same work.  For some, it was years before they found out.  And even then, it only happened because a manager accidentally let it slip or, as in Lilly’s case, a sympathetic co-worker quietly passed a note.  She only found out she earned less than her male colleagues for doing the same work because somebody left an anonymous note. 

We can’t leave that to chance.  And over the course of Lilly’s career, she lost more than $200,000 in salary, even more in pension and Social Security benefits -- both of which are pegged to salary -- simply because she was a woman. 

And Lilly, and some of the other women here, decided it was wrong, set out to fix it.  They went to their bosses; they asked for a raise.  That didn’t work.  They turned to the law; they filed suit.  And for some, for years after waiting and persisting they finally got some justice. 
Well, tomorrow, the Senate could pay tribute to their courage by voting yes for paycheck fairness.    This should not be a hard proposition.  This should not be that complicated.   
And so far, Republicans in Congress have been gumming up the works.  They’ve been blocking progress on this issue, and of course other issues that would help with the economic recovery and help us grow faster.  But we don’t have to accept that.  America, you don’t have to sit still.  You can make sure that you’re putting some pressure on members of Congress about this issue.  And I don’t care whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican.  If you’re a voter -- if you’ve got a daughter, you got a sister, you got a mom -- I know you got a mom -- (laughter) -- this is something you should care about. 
And I’m not going to stand still either.  So in this year of action I’ve used my executive authority whenever I could to create opportunity for more Americans.  And today, I’m going to take action -- executive action -- to make it easier for working women to earn fair pay.  So first, I’m going to sign an executive order to create more pay transparency by prohibiting federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss their pay with each other.    Pay secrecy fosters discrimination and we should not tolerate it -- not in federal contracting or anywhere else. 

Second, I’m signing a presidential memorandum directing the Department of Labor and our outstanding Secretary of Labor, Tom Perez, to require federal contractors to provide data about their employee compensation so pay discrimination can be spotted more easily. 

Now, I want to be clear:  There are great employers out there who do the right thing.  There are plenty of employers out there who are absolutely certain that there’s no pay discrimination happening in their offices.  But then sometimes when the data is laid out, it paints a different picture.  Many times they then do everything they can to fix the problem, and so we want to encourage them to fix these problems if they exist by making sure that the data is out there.

So everybody who cares about this should pay attention to how the Senate votes tomorrow on this paycheck fairness act, because the majority of senators support this bill, but two years ago, a minority of Senate Republicans blocked it from getting a vote.  Even worse, some commentators are out there saying that the pay gap doesn’t even exist.  They say it’s a myth.  But it’s not a myth; it’s math.  (Laughter and applause.)  You can look at the paychecks.  You can look at the stubs.  

I mean, Lilly Ledbetter didn’t just make this up.    The court, when it looked at the documents, said, yep, you’ve been getting paid less for doing the same job.  It’s just the court then said, you know, it’s been -- as Lilly said -- it’s been happening so long, you can’t do anything about it anymore -- which made no sense and that’s why we had to sign another bill.  It’s basic math that adds up to real money.  It makes a real difference for a lot of Americans who are working hard to support their families. 

And of course, the fact that we’ve got some resistance from some folks on this issue up on Capitol Hill just fits with this larger problem, this vision that the congressional Republicans seem to be continually embracing -- this notion that, you know what, you’re just on your own, no matter how unfair things are.  You see it in their budget.  The budget the Republicans in Congress just put forward last week, it’s like a bad rerun.  It would give massive tax cuts to households making more than a million dollars a year, force deep cuts to things that actually help working families like early education and college grants and job training. 

And, of course, it includes that novel idea of repealing the Affordable Care Act.    Fiftieth time they’ve tried that -- which would mean the more than 7 million Americans who’ve done the responsible thing and signed up to buy health insurance, they’d lose their health insurance; and the 3 million young adults who’ve stayed on their parents’ plan, they’d no longer have that available; take us back to the days when insurers could charge women more just for being a woman.

On minimum wage, three out of four Americans support raising the minimum wage.  Usually when three out of four Americans support something, members of Congress are right there.    And yet here, Republicans in Congress are dead set against it, blocking a pay raise for tens of millions of Americans -- a majority of them women.  This isn’t just about treating women fairly.  This is about Republicans seemingly opposing any efforts to even the playing field for working families. 

And I was up in Michigan last week and I just asked -- I don’t understand fully the theory behind this.  I don’t know why you would resist the idea that women should be paid the same as men, and then deny that that’s not always happening out there.  If Republicans in Congress want to prove me wrong, if they want to show that they, in fact, do care about women being paid the same as men, then show me.  They can start tomorrow.  They can join us in this, the 21st century, and vote yes on the Paycheck Fairness Act.    Vote yes. 

And if anybody is watching or listening, if you care about this issue, then let your senators know where you stand -- because America deserves equal pay for equal work.

This is not something we’re going to achieve in a day.  There’s going to be a lot of stuff that we’ve got to do to close the pay gap.  We got to make it possible for more women to enter high-paying fields that up until now have been dominated by men, like engineering and computer science.  Women hold less than 6 percent of our country’s commercial patents -- that’s not good enough.  We need more parents and high school teachers and college professors encouraging girls and women to study math and science.  We need more businesses to make gender diversity a priority when they hire and when they promote.  Fewer than five percent of Fortune 500 companies have women at the helm. 

I think we’d all agree that we need more women in Congress.   Fewer than 20 percent of congressional seats are held by women.  Clearly, Congress would get more done if the ratio was -- (laughter) -- evened out a little bit.  So we’ve got to work on that. 

And we’ve all got to do more to make our workplaces more welcoming to women.  Because the numbers show that even when men and women are in the same profession and have the same education, there’s still a wage gap, and it widens over time.  So we’re going to keep making the case for why these policies are the right ones for working families and businesses.  And this is all going to lead up to this first-ever White House Summit on Working Families on June 23rd.

So, ultimately, equal pay is not just an economic issue for millions of Americans and their families.  It’s also about whether we’re willing to build an economy that works for everybody, and whether we’re going to do our part to make sure that our daughters have the same chances to pursue their dreams as our sons, and whether or not we’re willing to restore to the heart of this country that basic idea -- you can make it, no matter who you are, if you try.  

And that’s personal for me.  I’ve said this before -- I’ve got two daughters and I expect them to be treated just like anybody’s sons.  And I think about my single mom working hard, going to school, trying to raise two kids all at the same time.  And I think about my grandmother trying to work her way up through her career and then hitting the glass ceiling.  And I’ve seen how hard they’ve worked, and I’ve seen how they’ve sucked it up.  And they put up with stuff and they don’t say anything, and they just take care of their family and they take care of themselves, and they don’t complain a lot.  But at a certain point, we have the power to do something about it for the next generation.  And this is a good place to start. 

So, for everybody out there who’s listening, ask your senator where you stand on paycheck fairness.    If they tell you that there’s not a pay gap out there, you tell them to look at the data, because there is.  It’s time to get this done.  And I’m going to do my small part right now by signing this executive order and presidential memoranda.  

END   
12:18 P.M. EDT"
"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.    Thank you so much.  Thank you.  Everybody have a seat.  Thank you so much.  I heard you all were in the house so I wanted to stop by.    

We’ve got some important personages here, so let me just call them out.  We’ve got Senator Amy Klobuchar.  Where’s Amy?  There she is.    Our outstanding Labor Secretary Tom Perez.    The chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Jenny Yang, is here.    One of my favorites, the outstanding Billie Jean King is in the house.    And of course, Lilly Ledbetter is here.    Lilly has just become a dear friend to our family.  And I can tell you that she’s beloved not just by us but by all the staff that work with her.  She’s just terrific.  As she just mentioned, she was by my side when I signed my first bill into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.  And I was looking at a picture of that wonderful event, and she looks the same.    And I don’t.   

But while we’ve got a lot to celebrate that day, we knew that our work wasn’t done.  We knew we had a lot more to do to close the pay gap between men and women, and ensure that no woman would ever face the kind of discrimination that Lilly faced on the job.

And everybody here knows the numbers, and many of you have experienced it.  Today, women account for almost half of the workforce.  But the typical woman who works full time still earns 79 cents for every dollar that the typical man does.  The gap is even wider for women of color.  The typical black working woman makes only 60 cents.  The typical Latino woman makes only 55 cents for every dollar a white man earns.  And that’s not right.  We’re talking about oftentimes folks doing the same job and being paid differently.  And it means that women are not getting the fair shot that we believe every single American deserves.

It doesn’t just offend our values.  At a time when women are increasingly the breadwinners in our households, paying them less makes it harder for families to cover the necessities like child care or health care, just to pay the bills.  It makes it harder for a family to save, harder for families to retire.  It means local businesses have customers with less money to spend.  So it’s not good for our communities.  It’s not good for our families.  It’s not good for our businesses.  What kind of example does paying women less set for our sons and daughters?

So today, we’re taking one more step in the right direction.  We are proposing to collect and report pay data by race, ethnicity, and gender from businesses with 100 employees or more.  And the goal is to help businesses that are trying to do the right thing, like the ones here today, to get a clearer picture of how they can ensure their employees are being treated equally.  A better picture of the data will also help us do a better job enforcing existing equal pay laws.  

This won’t solve every problem.  We’ve still got to get more women and girls into high-paying fields like science and technology, engineering and math.  We’ve still got to make sure that women are not penalized or held back in the workplace simply for starting a family.  Guys, we’re responsible for the family thing, too.    And they’re already doing more work than we are in getting that thing going.  They shouldn’t be penalized twice or three times.    

We still need to raise the minimum wage, guarantee sick -- (applause) -- guaranteed paid sick and family leave, fully protecting pregnant workers, finally passing the Paycheck Fairness Act to give workers more tools to fight pay discrimination.    

And all of us have to make sure that all of our young girls know that we’re invested in their success.  And, by the way, I do want to emphasize there are businesses that are doing the right thing.  We’ve got a good friend of ours, Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, which is consistently shown as one of the companies people most like to work for.  And part of the reason is, is that Marc understands that his company thrives when he is drawing from the entire pool of talent out there and making sure that everybody is having a chance to thrive and succeed at his company.  And when people see that, they’re working harder and more productive and more enthusiastic.  And ultimately, they make more money. 

So this is not an either/or proposition; this is a win-win situation proposition if we think about it in the right way.  That’s part of what Billie Jean taught us so many years ago.  I mean, those of you who are tennis fans, let’s face it, a lot of times the women’s tournaments are more interesting than men’s.  (Laughter and applause.)  And the notion that somehow we would be keeping my daughters or Marc’s daughters, or any of your daughters out of opportunity, not allowing them to thrive in every field, not letting them fully participate in every human endeavor -- that’s counterproductive.  It’s not how we’re going to build a great future for our country.

So that’s why, this May, the White House Council on Women and Girls will lead a day focused on women in America and around the world.  And we’re going to bring people from all across the country to examine the progress that we’ve made and the work that remains to give every woman and girl in this country a fair shot at success.  And we’re going to keep pushing until every single girl has the rights and the opportunities and the freedom to go as far as her dreams will take her.  

This will be a long haul.  One of the things that I am consistently reminding young people when they’re working here in the White House is that social change never happens overnight.  It is a slog.  And there are times where you just have to chip away and chip away, and then suddenly there may be some breakthroughs.  But it’s reliant on all of us to keep pushing that boulder up the hill, to just be steady and persistent, and understand that the work that we do today is ultimately going to lead to a better future tomorrow. 

And we will not see necessarily all the fruits of that labor.  The same way that Lilly described her endeavors -- when she lost that court case, she could have given up, but she didn’t.  And that spirit is what all of us have to adopt.  That’s the spirit that built America.  That’s the spirit that opened up opportunity for so many more people than a generation ago.  And that’s the spirit that I intend to keep pushing as long as I have the privilege to be in this office.

Thank you, everybody.    

END "
"THE PRESIDENT:  Well, good afternoon, everyone.  Megan and Margaret, thank you.  Thank you for being here.  And to all your teammates virtually, thank you as well.  I’m an unadulterated fan.  Not a joke.  Not a joke. 
 
And both of you and your entire team — I’m not joking — have inspired our daughters and our granddaughters, who, I might add, are all really good athletes: one two-time All-State; my niece, All-American.  There’s a whole lot of talent in the Biden family athletics, almost all on the women’s side of the equation.  But I — really, thank you for what you’ve done.
 
You know, you’re all heroes for so many people — and that’s not hyperbole to suggest that — on and off the field.  You know, and it matters that you lent your voice to the issues and the issue of fair pay and decency for so many years. 
 
Megan, it’s hard to believe it was almost a year ago that we met virtually during the campaign.  I said it last April, when we spoke, and I’ll say it again: The fact that Jill and I get to talk with you and your teammates makes us heroes with our granddaughters.  Not a joke.  I went so far as I took — they might may say — a privilege of getting our granddaughter Maisy, who is a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania — up taking a course right now — I got her on the phone so she — all she wanted to do was meet both of these women and meet them virtually.  And she’s a soccer player. 
 
And as Jill mentioned, seeing you win the World Cup back in 2015, that was an incredible moment for our family and our country.  And I didn’t bore you with all the pictures we still have walking on the field — (laughter) — no, I’m serious — and off the field.  You all made me a hero with my granddaughters. 
 
And the reason we’re here today is because it’s Equal Pay Day, which has been around for 25 years.  It was declared 25 years ago — Equal Pay Day — though not enough people know about that and — and they — as they should.
 
You know, it’s a day that measures how much longer women typically have to work to match what men make in a single year.  That’s what Jill was talking about.  And it’s shocking when you look at the numbers. 
 
Twelve years ago, when President Obama and I came into office, the very first law we enacted was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and Lilly was standing at our side. 
 
This year — that year, I should say, in 2009, we marked — Equal Pay Day occurred in late April.  By late April, women will have made, at that time, on average, what men make in 12 months.  They had to go all the way through January, February, March, and April to catch up.  That meant that it took women until April of 2009 to earn the same amount of money that a man made in all of 2008. 
 
Another way to look at it is, it took more than 15 months for a woman to earn the same amount that a man made in 12.  And more than three extra months — it’s more than that.  And it’s even longer for women of color.  And it’s wrong. 
 
This year, Equal Pay Day falls in late March, which is a little bit better, but not much — from late April to late March.  And, frankly, we shouldn’t be satisfied until Equal Pay Day is no longer even necessary to mention at all. 
 
The reality though is that in nearly every job — more than 90 percent of the occupations — women still earn less than men: 82 cents on the dollar on average.  For AAPI women, it’s 87 cents for every dollar a white man earns.  For Black women, it’s 63 cents.  For Native American women, it’s 60 cents.  For Hispanic women, it’s 55 cents. 
 
It doesn’t matter if you’re an electrician, an accountant, or part of the best damn soccer team in the world, the pay gap is real.  And this team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do and still have to fight for equal pay.
 
You know, as Jill mentioned, this pandemic has only exacerbated the problem.  Women are on the frontlines as essential workers, particularly women of color, in hospitals, grocery stores, childcare facilities, farms, factories, but they’re still earning less. 
 
More than 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce since the pandemic started — 2 million.  And now we’re at the lowest rate of women participation in the labor force that we’ve been in more than 30 years.  Let me say it again: The lowest — the lowest percent of women in the workforce — had to go back 30 years to get to where we are today.
 
A lot of that is because so much extra weight of caregiving and responsibility is falling on their shoulders.  It causes women to miss work, cut hours, and leave their jobs and care for their children and aging loved ones.  That in and of itself sows some discrimination.  How many men are staying home and doing it, and the woman’s staying in the workforce?
 
It undermines financial security.  And, by the way, it’s hard.  I was a single parent with two children after my first wife and daughter were killed well over 40 years ago.  And the fact of the matter is, I was a U.S. senator.  I was 29 years old.  I was making $42,000 a year, and I couldn’t afford help to take care of my kids while I worked.  Thankful- — thankfully, my mother — my sister gave up her job.  My brother — they helped me raise my kids. 
 
It undermines financial security for women and families.  It hurts our entire economy when we lose the talent and hard work of so many people.
 
In the American Rescue Plan you’ve heard so much about that we just passed, it was designed to address this core challenge.  It puts money directly into the pockets of people who need it the most: $1,400 checks for 85 percent of American households.  The hundredth million check has been deposited as of today, and many more are on the way. 
 
It also expanded the Child Care Tax Credit. And here’s what that means, for those who don’t know: Right now, if you file for federal income tax, you get up to a $2,000 credit for each child.  But if you need help the most, if you’re making a minimum wage job and you don’t have to — you don’t make enough to pay federal income tax, then you don’t get this credit. 
 
But because of the American Rescue Plan we passed, if you have two children under the age of six, for example, and you’re making $7.25 an hour — which is the minimum wage that so many people are making — you’ll get a check for $3,600 per child or $7,200.  Roughly, you get $500 a month mailed to you by the federal government.  That’s life-changing. 
 
The American Rescue Plan is going to cut poverty across the board in America by about 31 percent.  And that’s a significant lift up for women.  The law provides $360 billion for funding state and local governments.  What that means is that’s going to prevent layoffs on jobs often held by women — nurses, teachers, healthcare workers, home healthcare aides — because the states have to balance their budget, because if they can’t — because of the lack of income coming in without the help from the federal government — they’ll have to lay off those essential workers.
 
And the law also includes $130 billion to reopen our schools safely; $40 billion for — invest in childcare investments; $160 billion to get the country vaccinated and beat this pandemic.  All this is going to give millions of women, including many moms and dads too, the freedom to rejoin the workforce and make the career choices that are best for them and their families.
 
But there’s so much more we need to do.  So much more.  We need the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act — the bill to remove loopholes in the law allowing employers to justify gender pay disparities.  It would help hold employers accountable for systemic pay discrimination.  It would help level the playing field for women and people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge the disparities as a group.  It would increase pay transparency. 
 
By that, I mean, you know, there’s a whole range of American corporations — if you sign the Fortune 500 — you sign up with them, you cannot reveal — it says in your contract you cannot reveal your salary to another employee.  Why is that?  They don’t want me sitting there saying, “Well, I’m making $60,000.”  And the woman doing the same job, and she looks and said, “You’re making 60?  I’m making 40.”  They actually try to hide it.  That’s what I mean by transparency. 
 
Some employers may not allow you to know exactly, like I said, how much the person sitting next to you is making.  Some may even discipline you for asking that.  That has to change. 
 
Too often, secrecy is part of the problem.  We know information is power.  You can’t solve the problem if you don’t know you’re not getting paid fairly. 
 
My administration is going to fight for equal pay — for it to become a reality for all women.  It’s about justice.  It’s about fairness.  It’s about living up to our values and who we are as a nation.  Equal pay makes all of us stronger.
 
It’s not just women who care about this.  I’ve been around the country.  I’ve gone right into union halls and asked the men in the room, “How many of you — how would you feel if your wife or your sister didn’t earn the same amount of money as the man doing the same job next to you?”  And you hear them say — you hear them respond they don’t like it.  Why?  When your spouse or your sister is making the same amount of money the man she’s standing next is making, it means that when the hot water heater breaks, you can replace it.  You can get four new tires on the car.  It means everybody’s life is made better in that family. 
 
Let me close with this: that to come out of this crisis and build back better, we need to erase the gender pay gap by ensuring that women have access to good-paying jobs; by raising wages for working folks and fighting for the right to organize and collectively bargain, because we know unions lift women’s wages even more than they lift men’s; and by investing our care — in our care infrastructure — our care infrastructure — in paid leave, childcare, homecare — so that people can care for their families and also go to work. 
 
There’s a lot to do, but together we can ensure that our daughters have all the same rights and opportunities as our sons.  And if we’re able to do this, it’ll be transformational for our nation.  That’s the goal.  That’s what this is all about.  That’s what this team, all of you, are all about.
 
Let me make one more point.  You know, I’ve told my daughters, granddaughters from the time they got old enough to understand what I was saying — and I mean it: There’s not a single thing a man can do that a woman can’t do as well or better.  Not a single thing. 
 
I was among the first senators ever to appoint a woman to the Naval Academy.  I was just able to, as President of the United States, appoint two women as four-star generals, who now are combatant commanders.  Three out of the six are combatant commanders, and they’re women.  Women.  There are so many, some in the Congress, who were jet fighter pilots flying at twice the speed of sound.  So many doing so much. 
 
But this soccer team, America’s team, has done more to lift up people’s sense of who they can be, particularly young girls and women, above anything that’s been done. 
 
So, as President of the United States, I thank you.  I thank you for the example you’ve set and for your willingness to say, “Look, we’re not going to take it anymore.  We’re not going to take it.”  Figuratively speaking, “You can take my trophies, but you can’t take my pride.” 
 
As I said, my dad used to say, “Joey, a job is…” — when he lost his job and had to get another one.  We had to move.  He’d say, “You know, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.  It’s about your dignity.  It’s about respect.  It’s about your sense of yourself and your self-worth.  It’s about your place in the community.”  That’s what this is all about, and that’s why you guys are leading the way. 
 
And now it’s my great pleasure and honor — I’d like you to stand next to me, if you would, while I sign a proclamation making Equal Pay Day — naming it — an expression of our commitment to seek equal pay as we build back better and restore this economic growth. 
 
Thank you, folks.  I’m going to sign it now.  Come on over here. 
 
The title of the proclamation is “National Equal Pay Day 2021.”
 
THE FIRST LADY:  You can move up.  (Laughter.)
 
MS. RAPINOE:  I’m checking.  Just making sure it says what it says.  (Laughter.)
 
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s what it says. 
 
MS. RAPINOE:  I know.  Joseph R. Biden.
 
THE PRESIDENT:  Junior.  (Laughter.)
 
MS. RAPINOE:  Junior.  Junior.
 
THE PRESIDENT:  My dad.  He was a fine man. 
 
It says “Equal pay is a reminder of the work that still remains to advance equal — equality and ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to reach their full potential.”  Like you guys.
 
THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you.
 
THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thanks, everybody.
 
THE FIRST LADY:  Thank you."
"Equal Pay Day is April 2 this year, and with it comes the reminder of how far women have to go until they earn the same as what men earned the previous year.

The gender pay gap in the United States means that women make just 82 cents for every dollar that men do, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The problem is even worse for women of color. Black women made just 68 cents for every dollar white men did in 2017, BLS data showed, and Latina women made 62 cents on the dollar.

While pay equity hasn’t been a major issue in the 2020 presidential race so far, many candidates have, over the course of their careers, expressed their views on the wage gap. So in honor of Equal Pay Day, here is what each presidential candidate has said or done when it comes to equal pay.

Kirsten Gillibrand

The New York senator has put advocating for women at the forefront of her campaign. She has often spoken on the Senate floor on past Equal Pay Days, and her campaign website promises she will advocate for equal pay for equal work. Gillibrand has co-sponsored legislation called the Paycheck Fairness Act, a version of which recently passed in the House. The law would ban employers from asking job applicants how much they previously made, make it illegal for companies to retaliate against employees who ask about their wages and raise penalties for equal pay violations. When she served in the U.S. House of Representatives, she co-sponsored the House version of the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, a law that gave employees more time to file lawsuits alleging pay discrimination.

Gillibrand has also championed universal paid family leave, which research has shown could help close the gender pay gap, by introducing her FAMILY Act — which would create a national paid family and medical leave program — in every Congressional session since 2013. She also supports a $15 minimum wage. (Women make up nearly two-thirds of minimum wage workers, according to the BLS.) She is also a co-sponsor of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would guarantee legal equality for men and women in the Constitution.

Kamala Harris

Harris has also been outspoken about her support for equal pay and has put a particular emphasis on advocating for women of color. She has previously written about the topic and outlined strategies for increasing pay equity, including advocating for pay transparency, preparing black women for better jobs and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Harris also backs the Paycheck Fairness Act and has co-sponsored Gillibrand’s paid family leave legislation. At a February campaign stop in Iowa, the California Senator said passing the Equal Rights Amendment — which she is also co-sponsoring — is “the first step to lifting women’s economic status.”


Elizabeth Warren

Economic justice is a signature issue for Warren, and this includes advocating for equal pay and a $15 minimum wage. She has co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act and Gillibrand’s FAMILY Act, and recently joined colleagues in the Senate when they re-introduced the Equal Rights Amendment. Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, has also written pieces pushing for equal pay and gave an impassioned speech in the Senate in 2016 saying the fact that the U.S. still needs Equal Pay Day is a “national day of embarrassment.” In 2017, a conservative website reported that Warren’s Senate office paid women less than men, but it turned out their data was incomplete, as it left out several high-paid women in her office.

Bernie Sanders

The Vermont senator has often said he supports equal pay for equal work. Like Warren, he frequently focuses on economic issues, including pay equity, paid family leave and raising the minimum wage to $15. Sanders has co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act and the FAMILY Act, and includes “pay equity for women workers” on his 12-point economic agenda.

However, the Senator had to apologize earlier this year when a number of women who worked on his 2016 presidential campaign came forward with complaints about sexual harassment and pay disparities. “I certainly apologize to any woman who felt she was not treated appropriately, and of course if I run we will do better the next time,” Sanders said on CNN in January. During the 2016 primaries, he also faced criticism over the fact that none of the top 10 highest-paid staffers on his payroll were women. (The campaign did not respond to that controversy at the time.)

Cory Booker

Booker, a senator from New Jersey, is known for his active social media presence, where he often talks about advocating for women and being an unabashed feminist. He has co-sponsored the same legislation as many of his fellow Democratic candidates — the Paycheck Fairness Act, the FAMILY Act and the Equal Rights Amendment — and last summer he called for the Government Accountability Office to study pay differences between men and women in the federal government. He also supports a $15 minimum wage.


Amy Klobuchar

Like her Senate colleagues on this list, Klobuchar has co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, the FAMILY Act and the Equal Rights Amendment and supports raising the minimum wage to $15. The Minnesota senator has spoken out about the need for equal pay, and in 2014 her office released a report around Equal Pay Day showing that lower wages for women impact them not only while they’re working but also through retirement. She has also pointed out that pay equity is not just about salaries, but also about giving women equal opportunity to enter male-dominated jobs such as those in the STEM fields. Klobuchar recently saw some criticism after several reports alleged that she treats her staff poorly and has what some considered a restrictive paid leave policy. She defended her treatment but also promised to “do better” by her staff.

Pete Buttigieg

As mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Buttigieg has had fewer opportunities to speak out on issues at the national level than many of his fellow Democrats. But he has supported gender pay equity in his role as mayor. He has issued official declarations recognizing Equal Pay Day, and in 2012, he spoke at a pay equity rally in South Bend, noting that Indiana ranked 47th in the country when it came to pay parity. The gender wage gap “is an embarrassment to our country,” he told the crowd, according to the South Bend Tribune.

Beto O’Rourke

When he was a representative from Texas, O’Rourke co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act and the FAMILY Act. He talked about supporting women while he was running against Ted Cruz for the Senate last year, and has tweeted about the need for equal pay for women, including women of color.

Julián Castro

As President Obama’s former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former mayor of San Antonio, Castro does not have the same kind of legislative record that some of the other 2020 candidates do. He has called for a higher minimum wage and tweeted about how his mother supported women’s pay equity when he was growing up. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found in 2014 that San Antonio discriminated against three women by paying them less than their male colleagues and retaliated when they complained — all while Castro was mayor. Shortly before he left San Antonio for the Obama Administration, Castro ordered an outside review of pay disparities in the city, according to the San Antonio Current.


Tulsi Gabbard

As a representative from Hawaii, Gabbard has co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act and the FAMILY Act and recently spoke on the House floor in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment. She has spoken out on social media about how pay equity is an issue that affects all families and impacts women throughout their lives. Gabbard also supports a $15 minimum wage.

John Hickenlooper

The former governor of Colorado and former Denver mayor has not spoken much publicly about pay equity. In 2018, he did declare April 10 “Equity For All Day” in Colorado, though this was in coordination with an organization’s marketing push for its work to close the gender pay gap. A few years earlier, in 2013, Hickenlooper signed legislation that extended the federal Family and Medical Leave Act to include domestic partners in Colorado. Since launching his presidential campaign, Hickenlooper has said he supports a $15 minimum wage and that his vision for American workers would include creating a paid family and medical leave plan.

John Delaney

During his three terms representing Maryland in the House, Delaney co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Equal Rights Amendment and the FAMILY Act. He has frequently tweeted about his support for pay equity, and in 2015 he posted a photo of himself holding a sign that read “equal pay for equal work is a core American value.”

Jay Inslee

Inslee is the governor of Washington state, and in March 2018 he signed legislation that aims to reduce the gender pay gap in his state. The Equal Pay Opportunity Act requires employees to receive equal pay for equal work, makes it easier for employees to file complaints over unfair pay and protects them from retaliation when asking about wages. He also signed a law guaranteeing paid family leave in Washington and supports raising the minimum wage. On past Equal Pay Days, Inslee has tweeted his support, saying in 2016, for example, that the day serves as a “reminder of the work we have left to assure equal pay for equal work.”

Andrew Yang

The tech entrepreneur is running a very long-shot campaign full of policy ideas, and one of them is that he wants to fight for equal pay, according to his campaign website. Yang notes that women make less than men, and that women of color make lower still — something that he would solve by working with states to implement salary disclosure laws, requiring federal contractors to pay employees equally and launching new studies around pay equity in the federal workforce. One of Yang’s signature policy ideas is that he wants to create a universal basic income of $1,000 per month for all Americans, which he says would give women more economic independence.


Marianne Williamson

The inspirational speaker and author includes equal pay for equal work as a policy proposal on her website, supports the Equal Rights Amendment and says she would use the “full powers of the presidency to advocate for the things women care about.” Like Yang, she is a long-shot outsider and has proposed a $1,000 per month universal basic income plan.

Wayne Messam

The mayor of Miramar, Florida, Messam launched his 2020 campaign for president on March 28. He has not spoken publicly about pay equity yet, and his main proposal so far is focused on eliminating $1.5 trillion in student debt.

Donald Trump

President Trump has made varying comments on the gender pay gap over the years. While on the campaign trail in 2015, he said in multiple interviews that he supported equal pay for women in theory, but that the reality was difficult. “If they do the same job, they should get the same pay,” he said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe in 2015. But he said categorizing people could be “dangerous,” adding: “It’s very hard to say what to say what is the same job.” He also told an Iowa TV station that year that “[i]f you start to say everybody gets equal pay, you get away from the whole American Dream” and if everyone gets the same, “you’re into a socialistic society.” Trump told CNN that he “absolutely” paid women at his company the same as men and sometimes more, and former Trump Organization executive Barbara Res told Rolling Stone that she didn’t think her gender affected her pay while working for Trump.

Since taking control of the White House, however, Trump has made a number of moves that critics say could harm pay equity. In 2017, he stopped an Obama-era rule meant to address the wage gap by requiring large companies to report to the government how much they pay employees by race and gender. (A federal judge recently overruled the Administration and revived the rule.) And last year, Trump’s Department of Labor gave federal contractors a bigger role in the process of auditing themselves for pay discrimination, according to Bloomberg Law. In her speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump’s daughter Ivanka, now an advisor in the Administration, promised that she and her father would fight for equal pay, but a Washington Post analysis in 2017 found that the gender pay gap among White House employees actually tripled under Trump.


Bill Weld

The former governor of Massachusetts is the only Republican so far who has said he will challenge Trump in 2020. During the presidential election in 2016, Weld left the Republican Party to run for vice president on the Libertarian Party’s ticket. Now he’s returned to the GOP. In his early campaign stops, he has spoken about a commitment to advocating for LGBT people, people of color and women who experience domestic violence, but he has not talked much about pay equity. And though he wrote in a 2000 article that he thought it was “madness for the Republicans during the first Bush administration to be opposed to the Family Leave Act,” which guaranteed unpaid leave for medical and family reasons, he has not endorsed the idea of paid leave. During his time as governor, he vetoed minimum wage increases."
"President Obama shared his latest thoughts on the economy with a crowd at Osawatomie High School and made one almost funny joke about his Kansas roots. The speech's overarching message about economic justice was right at home in Osawatomie, the same rural Kansas town where President Teddy Roosevelt gave his now famous New Nationalism speech espousing the government's responsibility to protect human welfare and property rights in 1910. Obama was careful to point out this fact and tacitly compare himself to the mustachioed American hero, but he was also careful to push back against the notion of class warfare and stay focused on how to save the middle class. This wasn't just a speech, either. ""This IS the Obama economic argument for 2012,"" tweeted The Washington Post's Chris Cilliza as Obama spoke. ""We will look back at this speech as the rhetorical basis for what comes after."" 

We've included the full text of the speech at the bottom of this post, but you won't want to miss these key passages. It's a long speech. Or, rather, ""economic argument.""

On class warfare

This is the height of unfairness.  It is wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns $50,000 should pay a higher tax rate than somebody pulling in $50 million.  It is wrong for Warren Buffett’s secretary to pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett.  And he agrees with me.  So do most Americans – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.  And I know that many of our wealthiest citizens would agree to contribute a little more if it meant reducing the deficit and strengthening the economy that made their success possible.     

This isn’t about class warfare.  This is about the nation’s welfare.  It’s about making choices that benefit not just the people who’ve done fantastically well over the last few decades, but that benefits the middle class, and those fighting to get to the middle class, and the economy as a whole.

On inequality

This kind of inequality – a level we haven’t seen since the Great Depression – hurts us all.  When middle-class families can no longer afford to buy the goods and services that businesses are selling, it drags down the entire economy, from top to bottom.  America was built on the idea of broad-based prosperity – that’s why a CEO like Henry Ford made it his mission to pay his workers enough so that they could buy the cars they made.  It’s also why a recent study showed that countries with less inequality tend to have stronger and steadier economic growth over the long run.

Inequality also distorts our democracy.  It gives an outsized voice to the few who can afford high-priced lobbyists and unlimited campaign contributions, and runs the risk of selling out our democracy to the highest bidder.  And it leaves everyone else rightly suspicious that the system in Washington is rigged against them – that our elected representatives aren’t looking out for the interests of most Americans.

More fundamentally, this kind of gaping inequality gives lie to the promise at the very heart of America:  that this is the place where you can make it if you try.  We tell people that in this country, even if you’re born with nothing, hard work can get you into the middle class; and that your children will have the chance to do even better than you.  That’s why immigrants from around the world flocked to our shores.  

On collective sacrifice
When times get tough, the workers agree to give up some perks and pay, and so do the owners. … That’s how America was built.  That’s why we’re the greatest nation on Earth.  That’s what our greatest companies understand.  Our success has never just been about survival of the fittest.  It’s been about building a nation where we’re all better off.  We pull together, we pitch in, and we do our part, believing that hard work will pay off; that responsibility will be rewarded; and that our children will inherit a nation where those values live on.

And of course, on Kansas
It is great to be back in the state of Kansas.  As many of you know, I’ve got roots here.  I’m sure you’re all familiar with the Obamas of Osawatomie.  Actually, I like to say that I got my name from my father, but I got my accent – and my values – from my mother.  She was born in Wichita.  Her mother grew up in Augusta.  And her father was from El Dorado.  So my Kansas roots run deep.


The full speech
Good afternoon.  I want to start by thanking a few of the folks who’ve joined us today.  We’ve got the mayor of Osawatomie, Phil Dudley; your superintendent, Gary French; the principal of Osawatomie High, Doug Chisam.  And I’ve brought your former governor, who’s now doing an outstanding job as our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius.  

It is great to be back in the state of Kansas.  As many of you know, I’ve got roots here.  I’m sure you’re all familiar with the Obamas of Osawatomie.  Actually, I like to say that I got my name from my father, but I got my accent – and my values – from my mother.  She was born in Wichita.  Her mother grew up in Augusta.  And her father was from El Dorado.  So my Kansas roots run deep.    

My grandparents served during World War II -- he as a soldier in Patton’s Army, she as a worker on a bomber assembly line.  Together, they shared the optimism of a nation that triumphed over a Depression and fascism.  They believed in an America where hard work paid off, responsibility was rewarded, and anyone could make it if they tried -- no matter who you were, where you came from, or how you started out.  

These values gave rise to the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known.  It was here, in America, that the most productive workers and innovative companies turned out the best products on Earth, and every American shared in that pride and success -- from those in executive suites to middle management to those on the factory floor.  If you gave it your all, you’d take enough home to raise your family, send your kids to school, have your health care covered, and put a little away for retirement.  

Today, we are still home to the world’s most productive workers and innovative companies.  But for most Americans, the basic bargain that made this country great has eroded.  Long before the recession hit, hard work stopped paying off for too many people.  Fewer and fewer of the folks who contributed to the success of our economy actually benefitted from that success.  Those at the very top grew wealthier from their incomes and investments than ever before.  But everyone else struggled with costs that were growing and paychecks that weren’t – and too many families found themselves racking up more and more debt just to keep up.  

For many years, credit cards and home equity loans papered over the harsh realities of this new economy.  But in 2008, the house of cards collapsed.  We all know the story by now:  Mortgages sold to people who couldn’t afford them, or sometimes even understand them.  Banks and investors allowed to keep packaging the risk and selling it off.  Huge bets – and huge bonuses – made with other people’s money on the line.  Regulators who were supposed to warn us about the dangers of all this, but looked the other way or didn’t have the authority to look at all.  

It was wrong.  It combined the breathtaking greed of a few with irresponsibility across the system.  And it plunged our economy and the world into a crisis from which we are still fighting to recover.  It claimed the jobs, homes, and the basic security of millions – innocent, hard-working Americans who had met their responsibilities, but were still left holding the bag.  

Ever since, there has been a raging debate over the best way to restore growth and prosperity; balance and fairness.  Throughout the country, it has sparked protests and political movements – from the Tea Party to the people who have been occupying the streets of New York and other cities.  It’s left Washington in a near-constant state of gridlock.  And it’s been the topic of heated and sometimes colorful discussion among the men and women who are running for president.  

But this isn’t just another political debate.  This is the defining issue of our time.  This is a make or break moment for the middle class, and all those who are fighting to get into the middle class.  At stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family, build a modest savings, own a home, and secure their retirement.  

Now, in the midst of this debate, there are some who seem to be suffering from a kind of collective amnesia.  After all that’s happened, after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, they want to return to the same practices that got us into this mess. In fact, they want to go back to the same policies that have stacked the deck against middle-class Americans for too many years.  Their philosophy is simple:  we are better off when everyone is left to fend for themselves and play by their own rules.  

Well, I’m here to say they are wrong.  I’m here to reaffirm my deep conviction that we are greater together than we are on our own.  I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, and when everyone plays by the same rules.  Those aren’t Democratic or Republican values; 1% values or 99% values.  They’re American values, and we have to reclaim them.  

You see, this isn’t the first time America has faced this choice.  At the turn of the last century, when a nation of farmers was transitioning to become the world’s industrial giant, we had to decide:  would we settle for a country where most of the new railroads and factories were controlled by a few giant monopolies that kept prices high and wages low?  Would we allow our citizens and even our children to work ungodly hours in conditions that were unsafe and unsanitary?  Would we restrict education to the privileged few?  Because some people thought massive inequality and exploitation was just the price of progress.  

Theodore Roosevelt disagreed.  He was the Republican son of a wealthy family.  He praised what the titans of industry had done to create jobs and grow the economy.  He believed then what we know is true today:  that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history.  It’s led to a prosperity and standard of living unmatched by the rest of the world.  

But Roosevelt also knew that the free market has never been a free license to take whatever you want from whoever you can.  It only works when there are rules of the road to ensure that competition is fair, open, and honest.  And so he busted up monopolies, forcing those companies to compete for customers with better services and better prices.  And today, they still must.  He fought to make sure businesses couldn’t profit by exploiting children, or selling food or medicine that wasn’t safe.  And today, they still can’t.    

In 1910, Teddy Roosevelt came here, to Osawatomie, and laid out his vision for what he called a New Nationalism.  “Our country,” he said, “&hellipmeans nothing unless it means the triumph of a real democracy&hellipof an economic system under which each man shall be guaranteed the opportunity to show the best that there is in him.”  

For this, Roosevelt was called a radical, a socialist, even a communist.  But today, we are a richer nation and a stronger democracy because of what he fought for in his last campaign:  an eight hour work day and a minimum wage for women; insurance for the unemployed, the elderly, and those with disabilities; political reform and a progressive income tax.  

Today, over one hundred years later, our economy has gone through another transformation.  Over the last few decades, huge advances in technology have allowed businesses to do more with less, and made it easier for them to set up shop and hire workers anywhere in the world.  And many of you know firsthand the painful disruptions this has caused for a lot of Americans.    

Factories where people thought they would retire suddenly picked up and went overseas, where the workers were cheaper.  Steel mills that needed 1,000 employees are now able to do the same work with 100, so that layoffs were too often permanent, not just a temporary part of the business cycle.  These changes didn’t just affect blue-collar workers.  If you were a bank teller or a phone operator or a travel agent, you saw many in your profession replaced by ATMs or the internet.  Today, even higher-skilled jobs like accountants and middle management can be outsourced to countries like China and India.  And if you’re someone whose job can be done cheaper by a computer or someone in another country, you don’t have a lot of leverage with your employer when it comes to asking for better wages and benefits – especially since fewer Americans today are part of a union.  

Now, just as there was in Teddy Roosevelt’s time, there’s been a certain crowd in Washington for the last few decades who respond to this economic challenge with the same old tune.  “The market will take care of everything,” they tell us.  If only we cut more regulations and cut more taxes – especially for the wealthy – our economy will grow stronger.  Sure, there will be winners and losers.  But if the winners do really well, jobs and prosperity will eventually trickle down to everyone else.  And even if prosperity doesn’t trickle down, they argue, that’s the price of liberty.

It’s a simple theory – one that speaks to our rugged individualism and healthy skepticism of too much government.  It fits well on a bumper sticker.  Here’s the problem:  It doesn’t work.  It’s never worked.  It didn’t work when it was tried in the decade before the Great Depression.  It’s not what led to the incredible post-war boom of the 50s and 60s.  And it didn’t work when we tried it during the last decade.  

Remember that in those years, in 2001 and 2003, Congress passed two of the most expensive tax cuts for the wealthy in history, and what did they get us?  The slowest job growth in half a century.  Massive deficits that have made it much harder to pay for the investments that built this country and provided the basic security that helped millions of Americans reach and stay in the middle class – things like education and infrastructure; science and technology; Medicare and Social Security.  

Remember that in those years, thanks to some of the same folks who are running Congress now, we had weak regulation and little oversight, and what did that get us? Insurance companies that jacked up people’s premiums with impunity, and denied care to the patients who were sick.  Mortgage lenders that tricked families into buying homes they couldn’t afford.  A financial sector where irresponsibility and lack of basic oversight nearly destroyed our entire economy.  

We simply cannot return to this brand of your-on-your-own economics if we’re serious about rebuilding the middle class in this country.  We know that it doesn’t result in a strong economy.  It results in an economy that invests too little in its people and its future.  It doesn’t result in a prosperity that trickles down.  It results in a prosperity that’s enjoyed by fewer and fewer of our citizens.   

Look at the statistics.  In the last few decades, the average income of the top one percent has gone up by more than 250%, to $1.2 million per year.  For the top one hundredth of one percent, the average income is now $27 million per year.  The typical CEO who used to earn about 30 times more than his or her workers now earns 110 times more.  And yet, over the last decade, the incomes of most Americans have actually fallen by about six percent.

This kind of inequality – a level we haven’t seen since the Great Depression – hurts us all.  When middle-class families can no longer afford to buy the goods and services that businesses are selling, it drags down the entire economy, from top to bottom.  America was built on the idea of broad-based prosperity – that’s why a CEO like Henry Ford made it his mission to pay his workers enough so that they could buy the cars they made.  It’s also why a recent study showed that countries with less inequality tend to have stronger and steadier economic growth over the long run.

Inequality also distorts our democracy.  It gives an outsized voice to the few who can afford high-priced lobbyists and unlimited campaign contributions, and runs the risk of selling out our democracy to the highest bidder.  And it leaves everyone else rightly suspicious that the system in Washington is rigged against them – that our elected representatives aren’t looking out for the interests of most Americans.  

More fundamentally, this kind of gaping inequality gives lie to the promise at the very heart of America:  that this is the place where you can make it if you try.  We tell people that in this country, even if you’re born with nothing, hard work can get you into the middle class; and that your children will have the chance to do even better than you.  That’s why immigrants from around the world flocked to our shores.  

And yet, over the last few decades, the rungs on the ladder of opportunity have grown farther and farther apart, and the middle class has shrunk.  A few years after World War II, a child who was born into poverty had a slightly better than 50-50 chance of becoming middle class as an adult.  By 1980, that chance fell to around 40%.  And if the trend of rising inequality over the last few decades continues, it’s estimated that a child born today will only have a 1 in 3 chance of making it to the middle class.  

It’s heartbreaking enough that there are millions of working families in this country who are now forced to take their children to food banks for a decent meal.  But the idea that those children might not have a chance to climb out of that situation and back into the middle class, no matter how hard they work?  That’s inexcusable.  It’s wrong.  It flies in the face of everything we stand for.

Fortunately, that’s not a future we have to accept.  Because there’s another view about how we build a strong middle class in this country – a view that’s truer to our history; a vision that’s been embraced by people of both parties for more than two hundred years. 

It’s not a view that we should somehow turn back technology or put up walls around America.  It’s not a view that says we should punish profit or success or pretend that government knows how to fix all society’s problems.  It’s a view that says in America, we are greater together – when everyone engages in fair play, everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share.   

So what does that mean for restoring middle-class security in today’s economy? 

It starts by making sure that everyone in America gets a fair shot at success.  The truth is, we’ll never be able to compete with other countries when it comes to who’s best at letting their businesses pay the lowest wages or pollute as much as they want.  That’s a race to the bottom that we can’t win – and shouldn’t want to win.   Those countries don’t have a strong middle-class.  They don’t have our standard of living.  

The race we want to win – the race we can win – is a race to the top; the race for good jobs that pay well and offer middle-class security.  Businesses will create those jobs in countries with the highest-skilled, highest-educated workers; the most advanced transportation and communication; the strongest commitment to research and technology.  

The world is shifting to an innovation economy.  And no one does innovation better than America.  No one has better colleges and universities.  No one has a greater diversity of talent and ingenuity.  No one’s workers or entrepreneurs are more driven or daring.  The things that have always been our strengths match up perfectly with the demands of this moment.  

But we need to meet the moment.  We need to up our game.  And we need to remember that we can only do that together.     

It starts by making education a national mission – government and businesses; parents and citizens.  In this economy, a higher education is the surest route to the middle class.  The unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average.  Their income is twice as high as those who don’t have a high school diploma.  We shouldn’t be laying off good teachers right now – we should be hiring them.  We shouldn’t be expecting less of our schools – we should be demanding more.  We shouldn’t be making it harder to afford college – we should be a country where everyone has the chance to go.  

In today’s innovation economy, we also need a world-class commitment to science, research, and the next generation of high-tech manufacturing.  Our factories and their workers shouldn’t be idle.  We should be giving people the chance to get new skills and training at community colleges, so they can learn to make wind turbines and semiconductors and high-powered batteries.  And by the way – if we don’t have an economy built on bubbles and financial speculation, our best and brightest won’t all gravitate towards careers in banking and finance.  Because if we want an economy that’s built to last, we need more of those young people in science and engineering.  This country shouldn’t be known for bad debt and phony profits.  We should be known for creating and selling products all over the world that are stamped with three proud words:  Made in America.      

Today, manufacturers and other companies are setting up shop in places with the best infrastructure to ship their products, move their workers, and communicate with the rest of the world.  That’s why the over one million construction workers who lost their jobs when the housing market collapsed shouldn’t be sitting at home with nothing to do.  They should be rebuilding our roads and bridges; laying down faster railroads and broadband; modernizing our schools – all the things other countries are already doing to attract good jobs and businesses to their shores.      

Yes, businesses, not government, will always be the primary generator of good jobs with incomes that lift people into the middle class and keep them there.  But as a nation, we have always come together, through our government, to help create the conditions where both workers and businesses can succeed.  Historically, that hasn’t been a partisan idea.  Franklin Roosevelt worked with Democrats and Republicans to give veterans of World War II, including my grandfather, the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.  It was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, a proud son of Kansas, who started the interstate highway system and doubled-down on science and research to stay ahead of the Soviets.  

Of course, those productive investments cost money.  And so we’ve also paid for these investments by asking everyone to do their fair share.  If we had unlimited resources, no one would ever have to pay any taxes and we’d never have to cut any spending.  But we don’t have unlimited resources.  And so we have to set priorities.  If we want a strong middle class, then our tax code must reflect our values.  We have to make choices.  

Today that choice is very clear.  To reduce our deficit, I’ve already signed nearly $1 trillion of spending cuts into law, and proposed trillions more – including reforms that would lower the cost of Medicare and Medicaid.  

But in order to actually close the deficit and get our fiscal house in order, we have to decide what our priorities are.  Most immediately, we need to extend a payroll tax cut that’s set to expire at the end of this month.  If we don’t do that, 160 million Americans will see their taxes go up by an average of $1,000, and it would badly weaken our recovery.  

But in the long term, we have to rethink our tax system more fundamentally.  We have to ask ourselves:  Do we want to make the investments we need in things like education, and research, and high-tech manufacturing?  Or do we want to keep in place the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans in our country?  Because we can’t afford to do both.  That’s not politics.  That’s just math.  

So far, most of the Republicans in Washington have refused, under any circumstances, to ask the wealthiest Americans to go the same tax rates they were paying when Bill Clinton was president. 

Now, keep in mind, when President Clinton first proposed these tax increases, folks in Congress predicted they would kill jobs and lead to another recession.  Instead, our economy created nearly 23 million jobs and we eliminated the deficit.  Today, the wealthiest Americans are paying the lowest taxes in over half a century.  This isn’t like in the early 50s, when the top tax rate was over 90%, or even the early 80s, when it was about 70%.  Under President Clinton, the top rate was only about 39%.  Today, thanks to loopholes and shelters, a quarter of all millionaires now pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households.  Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1%.  One percent.  

This is the height of unfairness.  It is wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns $50,000 should pay a higher tax rate than somebody pulling in $50 million.  It is wrong for Warren Buffett’s secretary to pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett.  And he agrees with me.  So do most Americans – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.  And I know that many of our wealthiest citizens would agree to contribute a little more if it meant reducing the deficit and strengthening the economy that made their success possible.     

This isn’t about class warfare.  This is about the nation’s welfare.  It’s about making choices that benefit not just the people who’ve done fantastically well over the last few decades, but that benefits the middle class, and those fighting to get to the middle class, and the economy as a whole.   

Finally, a strong middle class can only exist in an economy where everyone plays by the same rules, from Wall Street to Main Street.  As infuriating as it was for all of us, we rescued our major banks from collapse, not only because a full blown financial meltdown would have sent us into a second Depression, but because we need a strong, healthy financial sector in this country.  

But part of the deal was that we would not go back to business as usual.  That’s why last year we put in place new rules of the road that refocus the financial sector on this core purpose:  getting capital to the entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and financing to millions of families who want to buy a home or send their kids to college.  We’re not all the way there yet, and the banks are fighting us every inch of the way.  But already, some of these reforms are being implemented.  If you’re a big bank or risky financial institution, you’ll have to write out a “living will” that details exactly how you’ll pay the bills if you fail, so that taxpayers are never again on the hook for Wall Street’s mistakes.  There are also limits on the size of banks and new abilities for regulators to dismantle a firm that goes under.  The new law bans banks from making risky bets with their customers’ deposits, and takes away big bonuses and paydays from failed CEOs, while giving shareholders a say on executive salaries.  

All that is being put in place as we speak.  Now, unless you’re a financial institution whose business model is built on breaking the law, cheating consumers, or making risky bets that could damage the entire economy, you have nothing to fear from these new rules.  My grandmother worked as a banker for most of her life, and I know that the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals want to do right by their customers.  They want to have rules in place that don’t put them at a disadvantage for doing the right thing.  And yet, Republicans in Congress are already fighting as hard as they can to make sure these rules aren’t enforced.  

I’ll give you one example.  For the first time in history, the reform we passed puts in place a consumer watchdog who is charged with protecting everyday Americans from being taken advantage of by mortgage lenders, payday lenders or debt collectors.  The man we nominated for the post, Richard Cordray, is a former Attorney General of Ohio who has the support of most Attorneys General, both Democrat and Republican, throughout the country.   

But the Republicans in the Senate refuse to let him do his job.  Why?  Does anyone here think the problem that led to our financial crisis was too much oversight of mortgage lenders or debt collectors?  Of course not.  Every day we go without a consumer watchdog in place is another day when a student, or a senior citizen, or member of our Armed Forces could be tricked into a loan they can’t afford – something that happens all the time.  Financial institutions have plenty of lobbyists looking out for their interests.  Consumers deserve to have someone whose job it is to look out for them.  I intend to make sure they do, and I will veto any effort to delay, defund, or dismantle the new rules we put in place.  

We shouldn’t be weakening oversight and accountability.  We should be strengthening them.  Here’s another example.  Too often, we’ve seen Wall Street firms violating major anti-fraud laws because the penalties are too weak and there’s no price for being a repeat offender.  No more.  I’ll be calling for legislation that makes these penalties count – so that firms don’t see punishment for breaking the law as just the price of doing business.

The fact is, this crisis has left a deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.  And major banks that were rescued by the taxpayers have an obligation to go the extra mile in helping to close that deficit.  At minimum, they should be remedying past mortgage abuses that led to the financial crisis, and working to keep responsible homeowners in their home. We’re going to keep pushing them to provide more time for unemployed homeowners to look for work without having to worry about immediately losing their house.  The big banks should increase access to refinancing opportunities to borrowers who have yet to benefit from historically low interest rates.  And they should recognize that precisely because these steps are in the interest of middle-class families and the broader economy, they will also be in the banks’ own long-term financial interest.   

Investing in things like education that give everybody a chance to succeed.  A tax code that makes sure everybody pays their fair share.  And laws that make sure everybody follows the rules.  That’s what will transform our economy.  That’s what will grow our middle class again.  In the end, rebuilding this economy based on fair play, a fair shot, and a fair share will require all of us to see the stake we have in each other’s success.  And it will require all of us to take some responsibility to that success.  

It will require parents to get more involved in their children’s education, students to study harder, and some workers to start studying all over again.  It will require greater responsibility from homeowners to not take out mortgages they can’t afford, and remember that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.  

It will require those of us in public service to make government more efficient, effective, and responsive to people’s needs.  That’s why we’re cutting programs we don’t need, to pay for those we do.  That’s why we’ve made hundreds of regulatory reforms that will save businesses billions of dollars.  That’s why we’re not just throwing money at education, but challenging schools to come up with the most innovative reforms and the best results.  

And it will require American business leaders to understand that their obligations don’t just end with their shareholders.  Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel put it best:  “There’s another obligation I feel personally,” he said, “given that everything I’ve achieved in my career and a lot of what Intel has achieved&hellipwere made possible by a climate of democracy, an economic climate and investment climate provided by… the United States.” 

This broader obligation can take different forms.  At a time when the cost of hiring workers in China is rising rapidly, it should mean more CEOs deciding that it’s time to bring jobs back to the United States – not just because it’s good for business, but because it’s good for the country that made their business and their personal success possible.  

I think abo"
"President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign released a new ad aimed at women on June 21, 2012.

Here’s the narration: ""The son of a single mom, proud father of two daughters, President Obama knows that women being paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men isn't just unfair, it hurts families. So the first law he signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help ensure that women are paid the same as men for doing the exact same work. Because President Obama knows that fairness for women means a stronger middle class for America.""

In this item, we're checking the claim that ""women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men.""

The 77 cent figure has become a rallying cry for those who seek to eliminate employment discrimination based on gender. And it’s a genuine statistic. In a report released in September 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau wrote that in 2010, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers was 0.77."" Translated into dollars, that means that in 2010, women working full-time earned 77 cents for every dollar earned by men working full time.

But the Obama ad takes a solid statistic and describes it incorrectly. The campaign is wrong to say that the 77-cent figure describes the pay differences between men and women ""doing the same work."" (By contrast, former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine recently earned a Mostly True on a similar claim because he was not specifying the number was for the same occupations.)

The 77-cent figure compares all male and female workers, regardless of their occupation. Whether due to a historical legacy of discrimination or because of personal choice, women and men are disproportionately represented in certain jobs. For instance, women dominate the ranks of receptionists, nurses, and elementary and middle-school teachers, among other fields. Men are disproportionately truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers.

""If more men tend to be employed in occupations that pay higher wages both to men and women, then men may enjoy an overall earnings advantage even if all women in each occupation receive exactly the same hourly pay as the men who are employed in the occupation,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.

Indeed, if you look at men and women working in the same professions, the pay gap is much smaller (though for most professions, it doesn’t disappear entirely).

For computer programmers, for instance, women earn 95 cents for every dollar a man earns. For cashiers it’s 92 cents. For cooks and customer service representatives, it’s 95 cents. Other occupations have more unequal ratios. Women who are personal financial advisers, for instance, earn just 58 cents of what men in that job earn. (The statistics come from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a think tank focusing on women’s issues.)

There are at least two other factors that weaken the accuracy of the ad’s claim.

One involves hours worked. While calculations that led to the 77-cent figure did not include any part-time workers, the label ""full time worker"" can actually be applied to employees with a wide range of hours worked per week.

The official Bureau of Labor Statistics definition of a full-time worker is someone who works at least 35 hours per week. Someone who gets no vacation time and works 40 hours a week for 52 weeks would work 2,080 hours in a year. By contrast, a worker on a 36-hour-per-week schedule who has two weeks off would work only 1,800 hours. Meanwhile, a worker with two weeks off who averaged four hours per week of overtime would end up with 2,200 hours.

""Some workers have even longer work schedules than that, especially when the economy is expanding rapidly,"" Burtless said. ""So even among full-time, year-round workers, there is considerable variability in annual work hours."" This variation can work its way into the gender pay gap if women seek more flexible schedules or if men happen to fill jobs with greater opportunities for overtime.

(PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

The other complicating factor involves seniority on the job. Men have typically held their jobs longer than women in the same position. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, men in 2010 who were between 45 and 54 years old had a median job tenure of 8.5 years, compared to 7.1 years for women in the same age group.

""Women have shorter job tenures than men because they have more work interruptions than men, usually because they have children and assume heavy responsibility for rearing those children,"" Burtless said. Improving access to child care or offering stronger protections for workers who leave the workforce temporarily to raise children, as some other advanced industrialized nations do, would probably decrease the wage gap, Burtless said.

When we contacted the Obama campaign, they reiterated the importance of the overall figures and noted a Bloomberg analysis that showed that only one occupation out of 265 with more than 10,000 men and women employed did women out-earn men -- namely, ""personal care and service workers, which include butlers, valets, house sitters and shoe shiners.""

""No matter how you look at it, women make less than men -- at the same job, at different jobs, weekly, annually and by occupation,"" said Kara Carscaden, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign.

Nothing in our analysis suggests that gender discrimination doesn’t exist. In fact, the experts we consulted agreed that no matter how much you adjust the models to equalize for outside factors, a difference in pay between men and women remains, and it’s one that can’t be explained away.

Still, those same experts also agreed that ad goes too far in claiming that the 77-cent statistic describes the pay gap for women ""doing the same work as men.""

""Sexism may explain differences in occupation, industry, education, hours and weeks worked, so it’s hard to know how much of the gap is due to discrimination. But (77 cents) isn’t the right statistic for saying ‘the same work as,’"" said Betsey Stevenson, a business and public policy professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and visiting economics professor at Princeton University who previously served as chief economist for Obama’s labor secretary.

Burtless agreed. ""It’s hard to defend the last seven words in the ad’s claim.""

Our ruling

The Obama campaign took a legitimate statistic and described it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it actually is. The 77-cent figure is real, but it does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure. Describing that statistic as referring to the pay for women ""doing the same work as men"" earns it a rating of Mostly False."
"President Joe Biden and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden hosted an Equal Pay Day event on March 24, 2021 with the U.S. Soccer Women’s National Team. Read the transcript of speeches from Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Megan Rapinoe, and Margaret Purce here. 

Margaret Purce: (00:02)
Good afternoon. It is wonderful to be here on a day as important as this. Over the past few decades, we have witnessed women progress in the workforce displaying excellence, commitment and resilience across industries. We have seen women rise to be champions for change, pioneers of thought, all while wrestling with systems that have been unable to upgrade at the same pace as them. Bravo, ladies. The strength of unequal pay rests on the notion of unequal value. It is an issue of equity. When men began sports leagues, they were supported by billions in taxpayer subsidies. They were prioritized in media and afforded time to grow. The investment was great and the return was great. I have watched and joined a league of women who are remarkable at their craft, and together, we have asked for the same grace that was extended to men in the formative years of their leagues, true investment.

Margaret Purce: (01:09)
I’ve spoken about equal pay in formal settings such as this and in informal exchanges. Often I’m resisted with declarations like, there just isn’t enough interest in women’s sports. My response is always this, you would never expect a flower to bloom without water, but women in sport who have been denied water, sunlight and soil are somehow expected to blossom. Invest in women then let’s talk again when you see the return. I went to thank the US Women’s National Team for being an emblem of hope, a voice of reason and a force for change. Mr. President, Madam Vice-president and Dr. Jill Biden, thank you for your commitment and attention to advancing economic security for women. We look forward to working alongside you. Now it is my distinct pleasure to introduce the first lady of the United States, Dr. Jill Biden.

Dr. Jill Biden: (02:33)
Thank you. Margaret, you’ve been called one of the most exciting players to watch this year. And though you are new to the national team, you’ve already stepped up to serve on the league’s collective bargaining executive committee. So thank you for your leadership and for being a role model to so many young women and girls around this country, thank you. So, hello everybody, and welcome to the White House. When I got my first teaching job, I was thrilled. After years of getting my degree and substitute teaching, I was finally going to be able to start the career that I had been dreaming about. And then I found out that they were paying me only 75% of the man who was actually hired the same time. I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t just the money, though that was unfair, it was the lack of respect, the discrimination.

Dr. Jill Biden: (03:45)
Why was my work worth less? We were working the same hours, teaching the same number of students and had similar experience. Well, that was in 1975. And today, all these years later, there are women who are still in the exact same position. This is personal to me because it’s personal to all women. It’s one example of how we still treat women differently than men, and it’s wrong. And as this pandemic widens the income wealth gap between men and women, it’s urgent because this issue is so much bigger than the number on a paycheck. Our work gives us a sense of purpose. It’s often how we make our mark on the lives of others and the world. For me, teaching isn’t just a job, it’s part of who I am. And that’s why when I became first lady, the honor of a lifetime, I also knew that I had to do it while holding onto this piece of myself. I had to keep teaching.

Dr. Jill Biden: (05:08)
As Joe’s dad used to say, a job is so much more than a paycheck. But our paychecks reflect how we are valued by our employers and even by our communities. How do we value women when they have to work three months and 24 days longer to make the same amount as their male colleagues? How do we value the black and Latina women who have to work many months more just to make up that same number. Equal work deserves equal pay no matter who does it. And since my first teaching job, we’ve made progress in many ways, but I don’t want my granddaughters to have to fight the same battle. I don’t want them to worry about getting paid less solely based on their gender. It’s way past time to pay women equally. And with the passion and dedication of leaders like Megan Rapinoe, I know we can get there. And Megan, you’ll have to forgive me, but I decided not to dye my hair purple again.

Dr. Jill Biden: (06:31)
The last time I saw her, I sprayed purple on my hair. But that doesn’t mean I’m any less excited that you are here. One of my most cherished moments with my grandkids was watching the US women’s soccer team win the World Cup in 2015. They were in awe you, especially our soccer player, my granddaughter, Maisie. And then you went on to become the first team in history to win four women’s World Cup titles. You’ve shown again and again and again that grit, skill and the ability to bring home championships have no gender. And you’ve been fearless in your mission to make sure that pay has no gender either. In fact, you and your teammates put your careers on the line for this cause. When you saw your male colleagues being treated differently, you stood up and you said, enough. That courage is why you are a hero to my grandchildren and fans around the world. Over and over, you inspire us to stand tall and speak out. From our whole family and especially our granddaughters, thank you. Thank you.

Megan Rapinoe: (08:27)
First time all day with no mask on, it’s nice, it’s nice. I’m sure you all feel the same. Okay. I need a fancy presidential binder, maybe one of these days. Dr. Jill Biden, thank you so much for the introduction and your amazing words. Good afternoon, everybody. It’s such an honor to be here today, so thank you two POTUS and FLOTUS for hosting Margaret and I. It really is a special day for both of us. There’s not many, I can probably count them on half a hand, moments where I find myself without the words to say, and today I did when I walked into the Oval Office here at the White House. You can’t help but pause and take a moment to acknowledge those who have walked these halls before you, thinking about the civil rights leaders and the champions of equality and the people who never made it into the room, but fought so hard so that others like me would. I can’t help but feel inspired and grateful to them, and also a deep sense of responsibility.

Megan Rapinoe: (09:43)
I’m a member of the LGBTQ community with pink hair. And where I come from, I could have only dreamed that I would be standing in the position I am today at the White House. I’m also a professional athlete and I’ve helped, along with all of my teammates virtually here today, one teammate literally here today, win four World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals for the United States. And despite those wins, I’ve been devalued, I’ve been disrespected and dismissed because I am a woman, and I’ve been told that I don’t deserve any more than less because I am a woman. You see, despite all the wins, I’m still paid less than men who do the same job that I do. For each trophy, of which there are many, and for each win, for each tie and for each time that we play, it’s less. And I know there are millions of people who are marginalized by gender in the world and experience the same thing in their jobs.

Megan Rapinoe: (10:53)
And I know that there are people who experience even more where the layers of discrimination continue to stack against them. And I and my teammates are here for them. We on the US women’s national team today are here because of them. We also know what it means not only to have allies, but to be allies. We know what it means when people kneel, to kneel with them. We know what it means when people stand and cheer, and we know what it’s like to be in a full stadium, thousands and thousands of people who chant together all at once at our moment of greatest trials, equal pay, equal pay. Beyond the cheers and the gestures, there is so much real work to be done on policies that continue to support equal pay, but also continue to fight against these injustices and inequalities. And not just for ourselves, but for those who are coming after us, who are watching us, potentially watching today thinking to themselves what may be possible for their future.

Megan Rapinoe: (12:06)
And that is why it is an incredible honor and privilege for me to introduce one of our greatest allies, our president, the president of the United States of America, Joe Biden. They got to do the cleaning and everything. It’s less dramatic because of COVID, but it’s okay.

Joe Biden: (12:29)
Thank you, thank you.

Megan Rapinoe: (12:29)
Thank you.

Joe Biden: (12:43)
Good afternoon, everyone. Megan and Margaret, thank you. Thank you for being here, and all your teammates virtually, thank you as well. I’m an unadulterated fan, not a joke, not a joke. And both of you and your entire team, I’m not joking, have inspired our daughters and our granddaughters who I might add are all really good athletes. One, two time All-State, my niece, All-America. There’s a whole lot of talent in the Biden family athletics, almost all on the women’s side of the equation. But really, thank you for what you’ve done. You’re all heroes for so many people, and that’s not hyperboly to suggest that on and off the field. And it matters that you lent your voice to the issue of fair pay and decency for so many years. Megan, it’s hard to believe. It was almost a year ago that we met virtually during the campaign.

Joe Biden: (13:41)
I said it last April when we spoke and I’ll say it again, the fact that Jill and I get to talk with you and your teammates makes us heroes with our granddaughters, not a joke. I went so far as I took what they might say a privilege of getting our granddaughter, Maisie, who’s a rising junior at the University of Pennsylvania taking a course right now, I got her on the phone so all she wanted to do was meet both of these women and meet them virtually, and she’s a soccer player. And as Jill mentioned, seeing you in the World Cup back in 2015, that was an incredible moment for our family and our country. And I didn’t bore you with all the pictures we still have walking on the field, no I’m serious, and off the field. You all made me a hero with my granddaughters. And the reason we’re here today is because it’s Equal Pay Day, which has been around for 25 years.

Joe Biden: (14:38)
It was declared 25 years ago, Equal Pay Day, though not enough people know about that as they should. It’s a day that measures how much longer women typically have to work to match what men make in a single year, that’s what Jill was talking about. And it’s shocking when you look at the numbers. 12 years ago, when President Obama and I came into office, the very first law we enacted was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and Lilly was standing at our side. That year, I should say, in 2009, we marked Equal Pay Day occurred in late April. By late April, women will have made at that time on average what men make in 12 months. They had to go all the way through January, February, March and April to catch up. That meant that it took women until April 2009 to earn the same amount of money that a man made in all of 2008.

Joe Biden: (15:39)
Another way to look at it is it took more than 15 months for a woman to earn the same amount that a man made in 12. In more than three extra months, it’s more than that and it’s even longer for women of color, and it’s wrong. This year, Equal Pay Day falls in late March, which is a little bit better, but not much from late April to late March. And frankly, we shouldn’t be satisfied that Equal Pay Day is no longer even necessary to mention at all. The reality though is that in nearly every job, more than 90% of the occupations, women still earn less than men. 82 cents on the dollar on average. For AAPI women, it’s 87 cents for every dollar a white man earns. For black women, it’s 63 cents. For Native American women, it’s 60 cents. For Hispanic women, it’s 55 cents. It doesn’t matter if you’re an electrician, an accountant or part of the best damn soccer team in the world, the pay gap is real.

Joe Biden: (16:46)
And this team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do and still have to fight for equal pay. As Jill mentioned, this pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. Women are on the front lines as essential workers, particularly women of color in hospitals, grocery stores, childcare facilities, farms, factories, but they’re still earning less. More than two million women have dropped out of the workforce since the pandemic started. two million. And now we’re at the lowest rate of women participation in labor force that we’ve been in more than 30 years. Let me say that again, the lowest percent of women in the workforce had to go back 30 years to get to where we are today. A lot of that is because so much extra weight of caregiving and responsibilities falling on their shoulders.

Joe Biden: (17:43)
It causes women to miss work, cut hours and leave their jobs and care for their children, aged and loved ones. That in and of itself saw some discrimination. How many men are staying home and doing it and the women are staying in the workforce? It undermines financial security. And by the way, it’s hard. I was a single parent with two children after my first wife and daughter were killed well over 40 years ago. And the fact of the matter is I was a US Senator, I was 29 years old. I was making $42,000 a year and I couldn’t afford help to take care of my kids while I worked. Thankfully, my mother, my sister gave up her job. My brother, they helped me raise my kids. It undermines financial security for women and families that hurts our entire economy when we lose the talent and hard work of so many people.

Joe Biden: (18:34)
In the American Rescue Plan you’ve heard so much about that we just passed, it was designed to address this core challenge. It puts money directly into the pockets of people who need it the most, $1,400 checks for 85% of American households. The hundredth million check has been deposited as of today and many more are on the way. It also expanded the child care tax credit. And here’s what that means for those of you who don’t know, right now, if you file for federal income tax, you get up to $2,000 credit for each child. But if you need help the most, if you’re making a minimum wage job and you don’t make enough to pay federal income tax, then you don’t get this credit. But because of the American Rescue Plan we passed, if you have two children under the age of six, for example, and you’re making $7.25 an hour, which is the minimum wage that so many people are making, you’ll get a check for $3,600 per child, or $7,200.

Joe Biden: (19:42)
Roughly, you get $500 a month. It’s mailed to you by the federal government. That’s life-changing. The American Rescue Plan is going to cut poverty across the board in America by about 31, and that’s a significant lift up for women. The law provides $360 billion for funding state and local governments. What that means is that’s going to prevent layoffs and jobs often held by women, nurses, teachers, healthcare workers, home health care aides, because the states have to balance their budget because they can, because of the lack of income coming in, without the help from the federal government that they’ll lay off those essential workers. And the law also includes $130 billion to reopen our school safely. $40 billion for investing in childcare investments. $160 billion to get the country vaccinated and beat this pandemic. All this is going to give millions of women, including many moms and dads too, the freedom to rejoin the workforce and make the career choices that are best for them and their families.

Joe Biden: (20:50)
But there’s so much more we need to do, so much more. We need the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. The bill will remove loopholes in the law allowing employers to justify gender pay disparities. It would help hold employers accountable for systemic pay discrimination. It would help level the playing field for women and people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge the disparities as a group. It would increase pay transparency. By that I mean, there’s a whole range of American corporations if you signed to Fortune 500, you sign up with them. It says in your contract, you can not reveal your salary to another employee. Why is that? They don’t want me sitting there saying, well, I’m making $60,000 with a woman doing the same job and she looks at you, “You’re making 60, I’m making 40.”

Joe Biden: (21:42)
They actually try to hide it. That’s what I mean by transparency. Some employers may not allow you to know, like I said, how much the person sitting next to you is making. Some may even discipline you for asking that. That has to change. Too often, secrecy is part of the problem. We know information is power. You can’t solve the problem if you don’t know you’re not getting paid fairly. My administration is going to fight for equal pay as it becomes a reality for all women. It’s about justice, it’s about fairness, it’s about living up to our values and who we are as a nation. Equal pay makes all of us stronger. It’s not just women who care about this. I’ve been around the country. I’ve gone right into union halls and asked the men in the room, “How would you feel if your wife or your sister didn’t earn the same amount of money as the man doing the same job next to you?”

Joe Biden: (22:41)
And you hear them respond, they don’t like it. Why? When your spouse or your sister is making the same amount of money the man she’s standing next to making, it means that when the hot water heater breaks, she can replace it. You get four new tires on the car. It means everybody’s life is made better in that family. Let me close with this, that to come out of this crisis and build back better, we need to erase the gender pay gap by ensuring that women have access to good paying jobs, by raising wages for working folks and fighting for the right to organize and collectively bargain, because we know unions lift women’s wages even more than they lift men’s. And by investing our care and our care infrastructure in paid leave, child care, home care, so that people can care for their families and also go to work.

Joe Biden: (23:40)
There’s a lot to do, but together we can ensure that our daughters have all the same rights and opportunities as our sons. And if we’re able to do this, it will be transformational for our nation. That’s the goal. That’s what this is all about. That’s what this team, all of you are all about. Let me make one more point. I’ve told my daughters, granddaughters, from the time were old enough to understand what I was saying, and I mean it, there’s not a single thing a man can do that a woman can’t do as well or better, not a single thing. I was among the first senators ever to appoint a woman to the Naval Academy. I was just able to, as president of United States, appoint two women as four-star generals, who now are combatant commanders. Three out of the six are combatant commanders and they’re women, women. There are so many, some in the Congress who were jet fighter pilots flying at twice the speed of sound. So many doing so much.

Joe Biden: (25:03)
But this soccer team, America’s team, has done more to lift up people’s sense of who they can be, particularly young girls and women, but anything has been done. So as president of the United States, I thank you. I thank you for the example you’ve set and for your willingness to say, look, we’re not going to take it anymore. We’re not going to take it. Figuratively speaking, you can take my trophies, but you can’t take my pride. As I said, my dad used to say, when he lost his job and had to get another one, we had to move. He’d say, “Joe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity, it’s about respect, it’s about your sense of yourself and your self worth, it’s about your place in the community.” That’s what this is all about and that’s why you guys are leading the way.

Joe Biden: (26:02)
And now it’s my great pleasure and honor, and I’d like you to stand next to me if you would while I sign a proclamation making Equal Pay Day, naming it and expressing our commitment to seek equal pay as we build back better and restore this economic growth. Thank you folks. I’m going to sign it now. Come on up here [inaudible 00:26:22]. Title of the proclamation is, National Equal Pay Day, 2021.

Megan Rapinoe: (26:44)

"The Paycheck Fairness Act, which aims to eliminate the gender pay gap and strengthen workplace protections for women, passed the House of Representatives on Thursday in a 217-210 vote.

The bill, which was reintroduced by House Democrats in January, has been met with opposition from some business groups who say it could threaten bonuses, prohibit employees from negotiating higher pay and make it easier for “trial lawyers to file large class-action suits against employers.” However, many workplace and gender experts have argued in favor of the bill, emphasizing that it could be a key step to achieving equal pay for women.

“I applaud the House of Representatives for passing the Paycheck Fairness Act,” President Joe Biden said in a statement released by the White House. “Closing the gender pay gap is more than just an economic imperative — it’s a moral imperative as well.”

Biden added that a full passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act by Congress would address the wage gap by “closing loopholes that have allowed employers to justify gender pay disparities, strengthening provisions for holding employers accountable for systemic pay discrimination, and helping level the playing field for women and people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge pay disparities as a group.”

Additionally, he said the Paycheck Fairness Act would make it illegal for employers to ask employees about their salary history in the hiring process and promote pay transparency by requiring more employers to report pay data to the government. Right now, at least 18 states already have laws in place that ban employers from asking about salary history.

The act would also protect workers from facing retaliation if they discuss their salary with co-workers, an issue Biden says is a “critical barrier to equality given that pay disparities often persist because workers are kept in the dark about the fact that they aren’t being paid fairly.”

Currently, women in the U.S., on average, are paid just $0.82 for every dollar paid to men. When broken down by race, Asian American and Pacific Islander women are paid $0.85 for every dollar paid to white men, white women are paid $0.79 for every dollar paid to white men, and Black women, Native American women and Latinas are paid $0.63, $0.60 and $0.55, respectively, for every dollar paid to white men. For some Native American women and Asian American and Pacific Islander women, the pay gaps they face are even more severe than the average that’s reported for their racial group.

While this isn’t the first time lawmakers have tried to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, with Democrats helping the House pass the legislation in 2008, 2009 and 2019, some experts do hope that this attempt will be different considering the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on women.

“Black women, Latinas, and other women continue to be undervalued and underpaid, even as they risk their lives on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis to keep the country going,” Emily Martin, vice president for education & workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center, says in a statement. “If we don’t close the gender wage gap, a woman starting her career today stands to lose more than $400,000 over a 40-year career. Latinas will typically lose over $1 million and Black women and Native American women close to that.”

This “life-changing” loss in income, Martin says, undercuts women’s “ability to navigate this crisis in the short run and to build wealth and economic stability for their families in the long run.”

The World Economic Forum predicts that the pandemic’s impact on women has only widened the gender gap that already existed. Prior to the pandemic, WEF predicted that it would take 100 years for gender equality to be reached globally. Now, that prediction has increased to 135.6 years. When looking at the U.S. specifically, WEF predicts it could take 61.5 years before economic parity is reached.

One reason why this gap has widened during the pandemic is because of the disproportionate job loss women have experienced over the past year, as well as the decrease in women’s labor force participation rate as many working mothers have been forced out of work by child-care demands. Since February 2020, women have lost more than 4.6 million net jobs, with many of these jobs being in service-sector industries that were impacted heavily by the pandemic, reports NWLC. By comparison, men have lost nearly 3.8 million net jobs over the same time period.

When looking at women’s labor force participation rate, data from NWLC shows that the current participation rate of 57.4% is the lowest it’s been since December 1988. Prior to the pandemic, women’s labor force participation rate stood at 59.2% in February 2020.

Both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have called the pandemic’s impact on women a “national emergency,” with Biden urging the Senate to “act swiftly to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.”

“Equal pay is about justice, fairness, and who we are as a nation,” Biden added in his White House statement, “it makes all of us stronger, and it represents what America is truly about.”"
"California Sen. Kamala Harris has a plan to close the gender pay gap, and it’s founded on hitting companies on one of their most prized markers: their annual profits.

As Harris’s plan is structured, companies with 100 or more employees would be required to disclose pay data to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in order to demonstrate that they’ve closed the gender pay gap between men and women who perform comparable roles. Companies that aren’t able to show they’ve achieved this would be penalized a percentage of their profits.

Her plan aims to fix a pervasive problem: Right now, women are still paid 80 cents on the dollar for what men make, on average, and it’s even worse among women of color. Latina women make 53 cents on the dollar, Native American women make 58 cents, and black women make 61 cents, according to a release from Harris. Those gaps have major implications for women’s economic success and their long-term earning potential.

Harris’s plan is significant in that it flips the way those disparities are being addressed: As things stand, workers can report concerns about pay to the EEOC, or file a lawsuit if they have concerns about a potential gap. If Harris’s proposal were to take effect, companies would have to proactively provide data to the EEOC every two years in order to show that they’re paying men and women equally.

The plan shifts the responsibility of proving the gap — or lack thereof — from the individual to the corporation.

Critics of such data-sharing programs have argued that the process for collecting and disclosing this information could prove too burdensome for companies. While analyzing such data is likely to have costs, experts say that many businesses already have most workers’ pay data at the ready. Additionally, as a fact sheet from the National Women’s Law Center indicates, many companies have already taken it upon themselves to conduct these analyses.

Harris’s approach, which also bars companies from asking about a new employee’s salary history, acknowledges just how entrenched the wage gap is and how much work it will take to meaningfully address it, experts say.

“It seems to really be framing this as a systemic issue that will help women and workers and working families,” says Mary Gatta, a sociology professor at CUNY Guttman.

Much like the Paycheck Fairness Act in Congress, Harris’s proposal would hold corporations responsible for demonstrating that they’re compensating workers fairly — and change the way the US government currently treats this problem.

“This plan will finally put the burden of ensuring equal pay on the corporations responsible for gender pay gaps, not the employees being discriminated against,” Harris said in a statement.

America has tried to address the gender wage gap before, but legal loopholes are part of the reason it persists
The US has passed key laws intended to address the wage gap, and while they’ve certainly had an impact, legal loopholes have enabled the pay disparity between men and women to endure.

The Equal Pay Act, enacted in 1963, was part of a package of “New Frontier” measures approved during the presidency of John F. Kennedy, in order to address inequities in the workplace and broader society. But because of loopholes in the way this historic law was written, employers have been able to legally justify paying men and women differently by attributing the discrepancy to four reasons, including seniority, merit, production output, and “any other factor other than sex.”

While the first three reasons haven’t been a significant point of contention, the last option is so vague that companies have been able to use it to explain differences in pay that aren’t clearly tied to the qualifications of each worker. Using this logic, companies have argued that a male employee was paid more than a female one not because of his gender but because they needed to offer him a more competitive salary than the one he was making at his previous job, for example.

Such actions help hide discriminatory behavior and effectively exacerbate any wage gap that may have existed before employees have even started working at a company. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which became law in 2009, gave workers more leeway to challenge pay disparities but did not address this core loophole in the original equal pay law.

Harris, one of six women running in the most diverse field of presidential candidates ever, is aiming to finally close those loopholes.

What Harris’s proposal would do
Harris’s plan has a few planks.

The first is the sweeping legislative proposal that would require corporations to certify that they are paying men and women equally, “after accounting for differences in job titles, experience, and performance.” Under that potential law, if companies aren’t able to do this, they would be fined 1 percent of their annual profits for every 1 percent of the wage gap that still exists.

This fine would be used both as a deterrent, aimed at getting companies to improve, and a funding source for a federal paid family leave program. And while large corporations may not feel the pain of such fees as much, a recurring penalty could be noticeable: If a company made more than $77 billion in profits in 2018, the fine on an annual basis would come out to $770 million for each lingering percentage of the wage gap.

Additionally, in order for companies to obtain “Equal Pay Certification” from the EEOC, they would have to commit to key changes aimed at making the workplace more equitable. Some of these requirements include agreeing not to ask workers about previous salary history, eliminating forced arbitration requirements on the issue of pay discrimination, and providing data about the percentage of women in leadership roles.

“The idea that there would be a fine for companies that don’t provide these documents is crucial,” Sunu Chandy, a legal director at the National Women’s Law Center, told Vox. Harris’s proposal would levy the penalty on companies that are not able to show that they’ve met the listed requirements.

Despite its expansive nature, however, the proposal does face some limitations: It would only apply to large companies, even though smaller businesses may have many of the same disparities. And for the law to go into effect, it would be highly dependent on Congress to help pass it, even though bipartisan support on this matter is sorely lacking on the Hill: While the Democrat-controlled House shepherded the Paycheck Fairness Act through earlier this year, for example, the Republican-majority Senate has not indicated any interest in taking it up.

Acknowledging the limits of congressional action, Harris has outlined executive action she could take as president. She would require any federal contractors to show that they were paying men and women equally, within two years of her taking office. Any that aren’t able to would not be allowed to compete for federal contracts over $500,000.

This proposal is the latest policy plan from Harris to address wage disparities; in another plan, she focused on closing the wage gap teachers face, and in a recent bill, she sought to narrow the gap between prosecutors and public defenders. This strategy could be an effective means to speak to concerns Americans have about stagnant wages amid rising living costs.

“Economic issues are clearly very important to Americans right now, and this is a great way to start speaking to them,” says Amanda Lenhart, the deputy director of New America’s Better Life Lab, which focuses on workplace policies.

Companies and other countries have already made similar moves to close their pay gaps
Harris’s plan is similar to one that Iceland implemented just last year and would mark an important development at the global level, bringing US policies more in line with those that have been established in many places around the world.

As part of Iceland’s policy, which was the first of its kind, companies needed to show that they’d closed their internal pay gaps or deal with daily fines. According to a BBC report, some of the early research on the Icelandic program showed that companies were keeping closer tabs on what they paid different employees after this law passed.

And Iceland is far from the only place that’s implemented pay transparency policies.

In the UK, France, Denmark, Germany, and Australia, to name just a few countries, there are already laws in place that require companies to provide additional disclosures about worker pay. And data shows that such policies work. According to a 2018 study by American and Danish economists, a 2006 Danish law mandating pay transparency from companies with 35 or more employees reduced the gender wage gap by 7 percent.

Today, the US is badly lagging behind other countries on this issue, even as some companies — like Salesforce, Glassdoor, and Delta Airlines — opt to conduct equal pay audits on their own.

According to calculations from Harris’s campaign, these disparities amount to $400,000 in lost wages over the course of a woman’s career, and $1 million for Latina, Native American, and black women.

Harris’s plan could be a way to finally get closer to eliminating this gap — or, at the very least, draw more attention to it."
"The pandemic has been ""devastating"" for women, especially women of color, Vice President Kamala Harris said Wednesday in an interview with USA TODAY.

""I think that the pandemic has exposed the failures, the fractures, the fissures that have long existed in our society, and it has made them bigger and more obvious,"" she said. 

Women of the Year wordmark
The yearlong pandemic has only magnified America’s gender inequalities, all while stifling the decades of progress women have made.

Women are leaving the workforce in alarming numbers. Female entrepreneurs find their shops shuttered or empty. Burdened with the brunt of child care responsibilities while children are learning from home, Black and Latina women in particular are falling deeper into poverty.

Harris characterizes the regression as a “national emergency.”

She said the country needs a commitment to universal paid sick leave and paid family leave, and ""child care needs to be affordable and available.""

COVID-19 has resulted in the disappearance of 4.5 million child care slots across the country because of social distancing and lockdowns, according to The Center for American Progress.


""We have many places in the country, including our rural communities, that are experiencing what we call child care deserts. So even before the pandemic, child care was not available and it certainly was not affordable,"" Harris said.

The latest stimulus bill, called the American Rescue Plan, provides $39 billion to the child care sector. Of that, $15 billion will expand funding for states to provide child care subsidies for low-income families with children 13 or younger; $24 billion will go to support child care providers and help them restart or maintain child care services. 

In addition, the plan increased the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 for children younger than age 6, and $3,000 for other children younger than 18. Children 17 and younger (the previous cut off was 16) will now be covered.

""Women should not have to be presented with false choices that say, 'You either have a career or you raise your children.' They should be able to do both,"" Harris said. 

Harris also has focused on supporting small business owners, meeting with many in her time in office.

The Backstory: When women are pushed out of workforce, it impacts far more than just the women themselves







Vice President Kamala Harris embraces role of representing American women(16:43)
STAFF VIDEO, USA TODAY
""I'm working with Janet Yellen, our first woman Treasury secretary, on what we can do to support community banks and get more resources there to get greater access to capital for our small business owners with, again, a priority around women and minority-owned businesses,"" she said.

Harris is a litany of firsts: the first woman, the first Black American and the first South Asian American to ascend to the vice presidency. In this barrier-breaking role as the nation’s second-highest elected official, she watches with a keen eye as the COVID-19 pandemic takes an unbearable toll on women.

She knows the expectations that she'll be at the table representing American women with thoughtful conversation and pointed policy. It’s a role she embraces.

In her USA TODAY interview, Harris expressed deep empathy and concern for women trying to claw their way out of the abyss, often carrying family members on their backs. 

When asked what message she would send to those women, Harris said she wanted to look directly into the camera. She wanted to speak to them about their resiliency, their strength, their ability to problem-solve.

‘There are three women who had a profound impact on who I am today’
Nicole Carroll, USA TODAY editor in chief: At USA TODAY, throughout the year, we are going to be celebrating women. We're going to be talking about extraordinary accomplishments, especially women who've been helping women. We know this pandemic has been particularly impactful on women, and that's what we want to talk to you about today, the road ahead.

As you've written yourself, more than 2.5 million women have left the workforce, many have lost jobs in industries hurt by the pandemic, others have had to leave because of child care or caretaking. So 2020 was devastating, and we'd love to hear your vision for our country and for its women in 2021.

Vice President Kamala Harris: The pandemic has been devastating to so many families, to our economy, to our children, and in the midst of this profound crisis, and actually crises, I think there are so many heroes and angels who have been exposed for their courage, for the value and the importance of their work and for their courage to keep doing it even in the face of exposing themselves and their families to harm and, in particular, exposure to COVID.

I think of, in particular, how I was raised, and there are three women who had a profound impact on who I am today. And in the midst of the pandemic, I have realized and reflected on their work and how the importance of their work has been highlighted through the pandemic. So my first grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, attended my law school graduation.

I think about my second mother, so Ms. Shelton, who lived two doors down from us when I was growing up. My mother, working long days, and she worked weekends often, and my sister and I would walk down (to) Ms. Shelton's house. And she was our second mother. She took care of us.

I think about people like Dr. Kizzy Corbett, the scientist who contributed to the discovery of the vaccine that I actually took and so many of us have taken, and what these scientists have done in terms of exposing not only the seriousness of this pandemic, but developing and creating the things that will save us and save lives. And my mother was a scientist. My mother had two goals in her life, to raise her two daughters and end breast cancer.

And she would actually take us to the lab with her often. And I watched how these scientists, they have this passion. It's a deep passion to improve human life and condition and to see what is possible, unburdened by what has been to see what can be.

So those are some of the things that I've been thinking about during the course of the pandemic. And of course, all of the folks I'm talking about are women and it really highlights, I think, the work that women have historically done and the work that women are doing currently.


‘We had racial disparities long before this pandemic struck’
Suzette Hackney, USA TODAY national columnist: As we know, Black and brown women have borne the brunt of this crisis in health care jobs, care taking, et cetera. It's just different for women of color. It's more critical. It's more devastating. What are the answers? How can we pay special attention to these folks?

Vice President Harris: I think that the pandemic has exposed the failures, the fractures, the fissures that have long existed in our society, and it has made them bigger and more obvious. We had racial disparities long before this pandemic struck. And when we talk specifically about Black women, take for example the fact that even before this pandemic, Black women were three to four times likely to suffer from maternal mortality, to die in childbirth than other women.

Let's take, for example, what we have seen during the course of the pandemic, which is that Black folks are exponentially more likely to contract the virus and die from it because of long-standing disparities around the delivery of health care and health care accessibility.

And when we talk about Black women specifically, you can look at the front-line workers, those folks who, be it in child care or in health care, who throughout the pandemic have been going to work every day, often taking public transportation, exposing themselves during the course of getting to work much less at work, to the virus, but doing the work that has actually been about saving lives, but taking a much bigger toll in terms of the harm that they've experienced from not only exposure to the virus, but exposure to the inequities around pay, around paid family leave, around paid sick leave, around affordable child care. These are all issues that have disproportionately impacted Black women in the workforce.

Carroll: You brought up the issue of pay. And as we know, women, especially Black and Latina women, disproportionately hold low wage jobs. Some of that's by choice, some of it's discrimination, and some of it's funneling women into these lower paid career tracks. What do you think it's going to take to change this imbalance?

Vice President Harris: Well, to your point, I'm told the majority of minimum wage workers are women and women of color. And by the way, federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and the math on that, that's $15,000 a year. And we are talking about those same jobs disproportionately being jobs that do not give paid sick leave, paid family leave. Those are jobs that make child care unaffordable.

And so what do we need to do? We need to have a commitment to universal paid sick leave, paid family leave. This is part of what we've done in the American Rescue Plan, saying that child care needs to be affordable and available because we have many places in the country, including our rural communities, that are experiencing what we call child care deserts. So even before the pandemic, child care was not available and it certainly was not affordable.

We also need to value the dignity of work. And when we look at the jobs that women are performing, in particular in lower wage positions, these are the jobs that invariably are about caring for other human beings. And we, as a society, should value that. It's an incredible gift that they give us as a society, but we have sadly diminished our recognition of its value and the reflection of our diminishing appreciation of its value is that we're not paying people enough money to do the work that they're doing.

Opinion
‘I’ve been focused on issues affecting women and girls my whole career’
Carroll: And just to follow up on that, and you mentioned this, but one of the main reasons women leave the workforce is child care. What should the federal government's role be in child care?

Vice President Harris: Well, one of the things that the president and I had been advocating, actually for each of us, throughout our careers, is we need to have a national commitment to affordable child care. And in many cases, the reason for that is that people are paying almost more for child care than they're paying for college tuition for their kids. That's how expensive it is. And again, speaking from my personal experience ... Oh, that every mother would have a Ms. Shelton in your life who lives two doors down who can help take care of your kids, but that's not the reality for most folks. And they need to leave their kids in child care, which means they need to be able to afford it so they can go to work.

And often the situation is that child care is more expensive than their salary. So it's both in terms of what we do to pay people their value, but also have a national commitment to affordable child care. We do that in the American Rescue Plan and there are billions of dollars that we have put into the child care system and also into what we need to do around extending, for example, at least during the course of the pandemic, everything from unemployment benefits to what we're going to do in terms of extending benefits for the folks around the $1,400 checks.

Hackney: Since you've been in office since January, what have you learned about issues facing women? What has surprised you and what resources are there, bright spots, and where are the disparities?

Vice President Harris: Well, I've been focused on issues affecting women and girls my whole career. So while I've been in office, the things that I've known before have been reinforced, to be sure. For example, for the years that I was a prosecutor, I specialized in crimes against women and children. And we have seen during the course of the pandemic when women and children are isolated and alone in that way, that we are seeing higher incidents of abuse. And it does highlight the importance of having a social service structure, having a structure where we have the ability to have safe places for women and children to go so that they can be free of harm and live in safety.

These are the things that we've been working on for years, understanding that women should not have to be presented with false choices that say, ""You either have a career or you raise your children."" They should be able to do both.

‘The president has been very generous in seeking my input and participation’
Carroll: You've been a major part of the American Rescue Plan. The president has said you're the first one in the room and you're the last one to leave the room at these meetings. So what does it mean? What impact does it have when women are front and center of recovery? Do the discussions or outcomes differ when women are at the table?

Vice President Harris:  Well, not only first and last, but throughout the meeting in the room, participating. (laughing)

Carroll: Of course. Of course.

Vice President Harris:  And helping to shape the discussion and to inform the decisions. And the president has been very generous in seeking my input and participation, so I have to say that about him. He really is really great that way and in many ways.

Look, one of the things that I've been focused on is what we need to do to support small business owners. And I've been meeting in particular with women small business owners. And again, the child care issue comes up, but also access to capital. I'm working with Janet Yellen, our first woman Treasury secretary, on what we can do to support community banks and get more resources there to get greater access to capital for our small business owners with, again, a priority around women and minority-owned businesses.

We want to make sure that there's an equal opportunity for access to capital for them to not only start their business, but grow their business, so this has been one of the areas of focus.

Another area focused in, and so this is part of the discussions we have in those rooms, is what we need to do around acknowledging disparities. So what we've been talking about, racial disparities, gender disparities. There is actually a bill that I had when I was in the Senate around creating a racial disparities task force and that is incorporated in our American Rescue Plan and the work we are doing to track disparities in terms of how populations have been affected by COVID, by the pandemic, by what we're doing or should be doing in terms of delivering resources to folks who need them.

Pay equity, (that's a) big issue that we've been talking a lot about and with a need to address in a very serious way, I think women generally (make) 82 cents on the dollar (for men); Black women, 62 cents on the dollar; Native women, 57; Latinas, 54. So there's the work we need to do there.

And also back to the point about the dignity of work, the work we need to do to fight for working women, to make sure they are receiving the wages and benefits they deserve for their work. I convened women labor leaders recently, who are everything from women who are working construction sites and building trades to the women who are teachers to the women who are front-line workers in the health care and services industry, home health care workers. And I brought those women leaders together to say let's work together on supporting women who are in the workforce in every capacity to make sure they are receiving the dignity they deserve and the dignity (is) being reflected in their wages and their benefits.

‘I know you’re lifting up people every day’
Hackney: Yes, so many women are struggling right now. They're stretched thin with child care, demanding jobs, public facing jobs. What would you like to tell them? We would like to hear from you. Leave America's women with a message, please.

Vice President Harris:  First of all, know you are not alone.

These have been difficult hard times, where you got to sit at your kitchen table after the kids have gone asleep, where you're trying to figure out how to make ends meet, how to get through it all.

Know you are not alone. Know that you are supported and know that your voice is strong. It's strong, and don't let any circumstance diminish that or take your power from you. You are powerful. You are powerful.

And when we all stand together, when we all stand together, that's when we are our best selves. And so let's continue to know we are not alone. We are all in this together. And keep doing what you do, because you have an incredible amount of courage. You have an incredible amount of conviction. You are dedicated. And so know that that is the sign of strength.

The measure of strength in my opinion is based not on who you beat down, it's based on who you lift up. And I know you're lifting up people every day.

You are strong."
"The gender pay gap is a multifaceted problem. It arises from a complex mix of cultural and economic factors, which range from gender segregation in the workplace through the availability of flexible working conditions to outright discrimination. Closing the gender pay gap will require a coordinated effort across our social, taxation and workplace relations policies. Eliminating it may take a generation.

Given this, it is entirely predictable that the Greens would draft a bill that contains only two substantive sections and gives us the grandiosely ambitious name Fair Work Amendment (Gender Pay Gap) Bill—the bill does not deserve this title. Labor is inclined to support it—we believe that pay secrecy is an obstacle to pay equity—but we have substantive concerns about the bill.

The bill only addresses one small aspect of the gender pay gap and its significant drafting flaws mean that it doesn't even address that aspect effectively. Labor has been considering this idea for some time and we believe a strengthened version, with the drafting problems removed, may have some merit as part of a suite of other measures. But this is the point: the Greens don't have a coherent, well-developed set of measures to properly address the gender pay gap, and yet that is what this bill purports to do. This bill is what happens when you draft policies on the basis of what they'll look like on a Facebook post rather than how they'll impact on the people who depend on you. We on the Labor side know that as a sole measure it simply does not go far enough in dealing with the disparities in wages between working men and working women in Australia today.

The bill has flaws which ought to have been addressed: there's been plenty of time, and the fact that they haven't been reveals the Greens' lack of real commitment to this issue. One wonders what they have been doing since the Senate committee reported. This bill has remained unchanged since it was first introduced in September 2015, during the 44th Parliament. Following its introduction in 2015 this bill was referred to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, which handed down its report in 2016, during the last parliament. The committee heard from a number of submitters—impressive evidence, actually—including many legal experts who identified obvious and also some unintentional flaws with the way the bill was drafted. The Labor senators' dissenting report pointed out that these concerns should be addressed. The Greens' report indicated that these concerns should be addressed but, disappointingly, they remain in the bill as we re-examine it today.

I say it's disappointing, but it is also predictable that the Greens have not addressed any of the concerns raised by submitters or by the opposition through amendments before asking the Senate to consider it once again. I acknowledge that Senator Rice said she was willing to consider amendments, but that is not good enough. Actual reform by a party that aspires to form government requires actually doing the work, not just relying on a more serious operation to deliver that for you.

I'll go through some of the problems. We note that the bill does not prevent pay secrecy practices; it merely prevents the operation of pay secrecy clauses in contracts or awards. Accordingly, it offers no protection for workers who are directed to keep their pay confidential by their employer or any workers whose company policies or procedures require them to keep their pay confidential. This means that should this legislation pass unamended, workers might end up incorrectly assuming they are free to disclose their pay without consequence when in fact they could face significant consequences for doing so. The Law Council, in its submission to the inquiry into the bill, also considered that the bill did not create a workplace right and that therefore it does not offer protection under the Fair Work Act 2009 if the employer were to take adverse action against an employee for revealing their pay. Again, as drafted, this bill won't fully protect workers who disclose their pay. Professor Andrew Stewart, a specialist lawyer in workplace relations and academic at the University of Adelaide, also observed a clear limitation of the bill in relation to coverage. He said:

… it seems to me that the bill has a number of potential flaws in some respects—seeking to go too far and in other respects not going far enough.

He went on to say that the flaws in the drafting of the bill meant:

It does not, as the explanatory memorandum claims, in my view, 'make sure that workers are allowed to tell their colleagues what they are paid if they wish to without fear of retaliation'.

In her submission to the committee, Professor Marian Baird, a gender employment relations specialist, and her colleague, Ms Alexandra Heron, suggested that the bill be amended to ban pay secrecy clauses to make the intention clear. Further, they recommended that the bill should be amended to ensure that the Fair Work Information Statement informs employees about pay transparency at the beginning of their engagement in a job. The ACTU also made this suggestion during their appearance before the committee, stressing the importance of making workers aware of their rights to disclose information about pay. Despite all this, the Greens have made no attempt to amend this bill as a result of the Senate inquiry which reported in November 2016, nor have they made any attempt to discuss this bill with the opposition to discuss how we might set about remedying these deficiencies. This is not how you behave if you are serious about addressing an issue, but the scope of the bill alone shows us that the Greens are more concerned about being seen to be acting than they are about actually making a difference. Addressing pay secrecy is important, but without any other policies it will barely make a dent in the pay gap. In this, as in so many other policy areas, the Greens have shown themselves to be disinterested in doing the detailed and unheralded work that accompanies all meaningful reform. It's not, of course, the only example, and it's not the only example as it relates to women.

I want to talk for a moment about the annual wage review that is currently being undertaken by the Fair Work Commission. For the second year in a row, the government's submission to the review has claimed that lifting the minimum wage would not have any impact on the gender pay gap, because they claim that most of the gender pay gap exists between high-income earners. This is wrong—this is not the advice provided by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency—and I want to talk through why it's wrong. The pay gap is not just about a man and a woman sitting side by side doing the same job for different pay, although that happens. Research shows that much of the pay gap actually arises from structural discrimination that operates across whole industries and occupations. That's more subtle than straight-out discrimination against individual women.

Australian workplaces are highly gender segregated. Men and women tend to be clustered in different jobs in different sectors. The problem is that the more women there are in a type of occupation or sector, the more likely it is that that sector is poorly paid when compared to male-dominated occupations or sectors. What it means in practice is that workers with very similar experience and workers with very similar levels of education are paid different amounts depending on whether they work in a male- or a female-dominated field. We're talking about a certificate III being worth more if you work as a mechanic than it is if you work in child care. We're talking about the maintenance department staff being paid more than the cafeteria staff.

Those on the other side would probably say that these different kinds of labour are just valued differently in the market. It might be that some colleagues on the crossbench and some colleagues in the Greens seats would say the same thing. They'd say that this is just a case of the market at work, but this is actually a case of the market not working. As a society, we have consistently undervalued women's work. Pay is particularly bad in roles that mirror the work that women have traditionally done at home, such as care work. We are pretty terrible at recognising the value of that work when it is done by family members. We have not been much better at recognising it when it's being done by female professionals. It's not an answer to just say, 'Oh well, men and women choose different career paths.' There's a complex set of factors that push both men and women into gender-typical careers. Individual choice is not a remedy to this, and many women have no choice. Some female-dominated fields are female dominant because they are the only place that offers truly flexible roles where women can combine their caring obligations with professional work.

In the long run it may not even matter what field women choose. Research shows that pay drops once women begin to take over a male-dominated field. A landmark US study examined over half a century of data, and they found that wages fell for everyone, from ticket sellers to designers, as their field became more feminised. If women changing careers isn't the answer, what is?

This is where the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review comes in. In Labor's submission to the 2018 Fair Work Commission annual wage review, we reinforced that a significant contributing factor to the size of the gender pay gap is the fact that women are more likely to be employed in low-paid industries and jobs and that they're more likely than their male counterparts to be reliant on award wages. We called on the commission to give weight to equal remuneration and closing the gender pay gap in the annual wage review. What did the Greens' submission say? Nothing. They didn't bother to make one. Now, I don't know whether that's because the Greens don't have the capacity for detailed, low-profile policy work or whether it is because they simply don't think it's important. But it is important. It's very important, and the commissioner's decision will make a difference to millions of Australian workers and many, many women. Policy change requires more than a self-congratulatory social media post.

In contrast, Labor is committed to a suite of reforms to address the gender pay gap, and we have a track record of making meaningful change from the government benches. Employers now measure and report their progress on gender equality over time under Labor's Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 and the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. We delivered national paid parental leave so that families don't have to make the difficult choice between time with a new baby and covering all the bills. Labor delivered affordable, flexible and high-quality child care so that working parents have a real choice and better care for their children. And we locked in more protection for women and men against discrimination and sexual harassment through amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act.

When we come back to government we'll return with a bold agenda. We know that we need a strong and comprehensive plan for gender equality to address the persistent and shameful gender pay gap in Australia today. On 7 March this year we launched a national strategy for gender equality and highlighted our commitment to make gender equality a central priority for a future Labor government. Only our comprehensive strategy, not a piecemeal strategy, will achieve gender equality in our workplaces. So far we have committed to tangible reforms and targets to achieve this in both the public and the private sector.

I'll take you through some of it. It's a very long list. We will take measurable action to close the gender pay gap and we will report annually to parliament on our progress. We will reduce the gap in women's workforce participation by 25 per cent by 2025. We will raise representation of women on government boards to 50 per cent within the first term of government. We will boost the representation of women in chair and deputy chair positions on government boards to 40 per cent by 2025. We will set a stretch target of 50 per cent representation of women in senior Public Service roles by 2025. To ensure that women's voices are heard by government, we will boost funding to the six national women's alliances, which represent over 180 women's organisations. They'll take the lead in bringing forward the views, voices and issues of Australian women, in particular women from marginalised and disadvantaged groups. We'll provide $15.2 million to the Australian Bureau of Statistics to conduct the time use survey in 2020 and again in 2027. And then we'll have the evidence base to help us better understand how government policies impact women.

We will take action to protect university students from sexual harassment and sexual assault. We'll set up frameworks for gender-responsive policy and decision-making, including introducing gender impact statements on cabinet submissions and new policy proposals. We'll bring back the women's budget statement and we will convene a ministerial council of gender equality. We'll restore the penalty rates, cuts to which have disproportionately impacted women on low incomes. We will put 10 days of paid domestic violence leave into the National Employment Standards. We will make sure that procurement rules are implemented effectively to ensure that all companies that are awarded government contracts meet the Workplace Gender Equality Agency's requirements. We will work with the Australian Public Service Commission and the CPSU to promote more flexible working arrangements for both men and women in the Australian Public Service. And we are committed to an industrial relations system that can address the gendered undervaluation of work and to improve the wages of low-paid women. This is what a commitment to economic justice for women actually looks like.

The government have been asleep at the wheel on this issue. They have been hopeless. But we expect that from them. They have very little interest in gender equality. Take a look at the composition of the coalition party room. Take a look at the composition of the coalition front bench. This government cannot point to a single thing that they have done to improve pay for low-income women. They cannot point to a single thing they have done to reduce the gender pay gap or to make society more equal or more fair, because they do not believe in it. We expect this from a conservative government.

But it is disappointing that the Greens aren't prepared to do more either. It is not enough to be progressive on Twitter. You do not solve the gender pay gap by just putting the phrase in the title of the bill. Change takes commitment, and it takes hard, and often low-profile, work. And I would like to invite the Greens to join us in displaying either."
"PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday cast his administration’s push to reduce pay disparities between men and women in personal terms and said such wage gaps are something that could hypothetically affect his life as well as those of other men.

“This is not a women’s issue, this is a family issue. Women now bring in close to half of all income, and there are a whole lot of families out there where the woman is the primary breadwinner,” Obama said during a townhall-type event in Pittsburgh, before referring to his wife, Michelle.

“And if Michelle is not being paid fairly, then that’s not helping me. I want her to get what she rightfully deserves. I want her being paid the same as a man doing the same job, because that is helping our family.”

Michelle Obama earned more money than her husband at times during their marriage but does not draw a salary as first lady. The president noted that, as well.

“I will say, the first lady is kind of a bad example, because the first lady doesn’t get paid. And she works pretty hard,” he said, before adding quickly: “Obviously, we’re OK.”

Obama has made millions in dollars from the sale of his books. As president he earns $400,000 a year.

Obama’s quick catch about his financial position came a Hillary Clinton, his former secretary of state and a potential 2016 presidential candidate, takes heat for saying in her new book, “Hard Choices,” that she and her husband, President Bill Clinton, were broke when he left the White House.


The Clintons are now multi-millionaires.

Obama was in Pittsburgh to tour a do-it-yourself workshop where entrepreneurs share equipment and technology. The trip was part of a push to promote manufacturing.

Obama said he wants to spur U.S. manufacturing as a central part of his economic development agenda for the rest of his presidency, and said a “Maker Faire” planned for the White House on Wednesday was a good way to promote entrepreneurship.

He announced his administration would make it easier for people starting or expanding manufacturing businesses to make use of government equipment and research. Five government agencies will spend $150 million to produce sophisticated materials that have promising commercial applications, he added."
"April 12 is Equal Pay Day, where the fight for pay equality comes into the spotlight; the date is determined by how far into each year women would have to work to earn the same amount as men in the previous year. To get 12 months worth of male income, women would have to work on average three and a half months longer. (In the U.K., Equal Pay Day happens in early November, because that's the month where women start effectively working for ""free"" for the remainder of the year.) As a symbol of serious gender inequality in pay, it's a pretty powerful one; but what does the GOP have to say about wage gaps and new laws designed to target them?

The attitude of Republicans towards wage gap legislation tends to be pretty negative, for varying reasons. One is opposition to wage control legislation of any kind when, their argument goes, there's already enough government interference in wage-setting across the United States. Another is that equal pay laws obscure skill imbalances and what ""equal work"" actually means. And then there are the Republicans who refuse to acknowledge that there's a problem, either insisting that women are always paid what they're worth or blaming the difference on factors other than sexism. It's a complex knot to unravel. (President Obama, in case you haven't been following, has been attempting to make firms more accountable for wage gaps, including the announcement in January of rules requiring firms to disclose gender salary information in annual reports.)

So what do various famous Republicans have to say about equal pay? The answers may not surprise you, but they'll likely frustrate you.

Donald Trump

""You're gonna make the same if you do as good a job.""
""When it comes to categorizing people, men and women into a group, it gets to be very dangerous. When you have to categorize men and women into a particular group and a particular pay scale, it gets very—because people do different jobs. It's very hard to say what is the same job. It's a very, very tricky question. And I talked about competition with other places and other parts of the world, Mika. This is one of the things we have to look at very strongly.""
As I'm not actually qualified to de-scramble word salad, it's not entirely clear to me what Trump was going on about in these two statements, both made in 2015; but he seems to be putting forward a few of the damaging myths about gender pay equality. One is that unequal pay is due to the skills of the person doing the job, not their gender, and the other is that determining ""what is the same job"" is actually very tricky, so determining pay discrimination is difficult. (Neither of which are true.)

Rand Paul

""In the Soviet Union, the Politburo decided the price of bread. They either had no bread or too much bread, so setting prices on wages by the government is always a bad idea. ... The minute you set up a fairness czar to determine what wages are, you give away freedom. When you give that power to someone to make decisions, they may well discriminate in favor of whoever they want to discriminate in favor of.""
Libertarian Paul compared the 2012 Paycheck Fairness Act to artificial price-setting in the Soviet Union, which should indicate how moderate he was about the whole thing. Paul has stated that he believes the market sets wages based on each worker's ability to do their job, not due to any underlying bias or sexism.

Ted Cruz

""Equal pay for equal work has been the law for decades."" (2015)
""[Equal pay legislation is] just empowering trial lawyers to file lawsuits."" (2014)
These two separate quotes, from successive years, show Cruz's overt opposition to more equal pay legislation, which is based on the desire for less government interference. He thinks the previous laws are good enough and that any more legislation that allows firms not paying equal wages is just an excuse for frivolous lawsuits. Yep. Equal pay lawsuits: such a waste of everybody's time!

Rick Perry

""[Equal pay legislation is] nonsense. Why do we need to muddle up our statutes when we already have laws on the book that clearly take care of this? I mean, I probably got more female chiefs of staff than anybody in Texas history. And the fact is, they get paid well because of the performance that they do.""
Another less-legislation proponent, Perry basically thought this was all taken care of ages ago, because he personally pays his female staffers well. And here we have the ""skill determines pay"" myth again, which is idealistic but, unfortunately, not accurate.

Jeb Bush


""What's the Paycheck Fairness Act?""
Well, that proves how highly wage equality featured on Jeb Bush's priority list, at least.

John Kasich

""Well, a lot of it is based on experience. A lot of different factors go into it. It's all tied up in skills. Do you not have the skills to be able to compete?""
This was part of a bewildering exchange with the U.S. Hispanic Chamber Of Commerce chief Javier Palomarez in 2015, where Palomarez asked for Kasich's explanation for the wage gap and Kasich offered up this gem. Palomarez apparently responded by asking if Kasich thought female workers were less skilled, at which Kasich demurred: ""No, no, of course not... I understand that if you exclude women, you're not as effective.""

Kelly Ayotte

""Men and women should be paid based on their experience and qualifications — regardless of their gender — but unfortunately, incidents of gender-based pay discrimination still exist. The GAP Act strengthens our equal pay laws and gives employees the knowledge and tools they need to combat wage inequality.""

It's important to note that some Republicans do acknowledge that the gender pay gap may be a problem, even though the language they use about is about isolated ""incidents."" But the bill Senator Ayotte and some fellow Republicans submitted to address it in 2015, as Salon pointed out at the time, only said that women were ""concerned"" about wage gaps, not that they actually existed or had any systemic problem behind them. Not Going Far Enough 101.

Glenn Grothman

""You could argue that money is more important for men. I think a guy in their first job, maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday, may be a little more money-conscious. To attribute everything to a so-called bias in the workplace is just not true.""
I'm going to be really nice here, and hope that the Wisconsin congressman Grothman is an outlier instead of a bastion of normal Republican thought. Because the idea that men are ""a little more money-conscious"" and money is ""more important"" to them, which Grothman actually said aloud in 2012, is blatant nonsense to anybody who has ever encountered a woman in the 20th or 21st century. Welcome to crackpot justifications of gender pay gaps: that it's all because of some kind of inherent gender-based inequality and skill problems, rather than a cocktail that includes sexist exterior expectations or structures."
